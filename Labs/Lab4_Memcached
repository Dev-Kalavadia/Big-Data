## Warning: This is just a demo with Telenet
## For your own exercice/assignement, use a library such as pymemcache (python) or libmemcahed (c++)


## With Telent, pay attention to the format of the set operation
## set <name> <flag> <time to live> <bytes> 
## hit enter
## input exactly the number of bytes you specified
## for example, one char is 1 byte


$telnet 127.0.0.1 11211

set v0 0 10 1 h
set v1 0 0 10 TestValue1
get v1
get v0 
delete v1
