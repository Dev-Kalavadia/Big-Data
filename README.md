# Big-Data Systems Course
 Big Data Systems Class Repo 


## Course Description
Businesses, governments, individuals, scientific tools, and smart devices continuously create massive amounts of data at an unprecedented scale. Mining or even querying such datasets have become increasingly difficult. Standard database systems were not designed to deal with the size and dynamic format of datasets. This course focuses on conceptual and architectural issues related to designing and deploying data management systems in a "big data" context (Large data volume, velocity, and variety).


The course first reviewed distributed transaction processing techniques, classical parallel database systems, and ACID-style semantics in shared-nothing architectures. Then, it delved into various distributed data processing techniques, with an emphasis on solutions based on clusters of commodity machines and handling embarrassingly parallel computing problems. Particularly, we covered distributed storage systems (such as Google File system, HDFS), wide-area hash-tables (like Cassandra), data-intensive computing platforms (Hadoop, Spark), and NoSQL systems. Hands-on programming exercises and deployments of such platforms will be a central part of the course.
