Initialize Zookeeper client and establish a connection.

Create a znode (or node) for each philosopher in Zookeeper to represent their state.

Each philosopher will have three states: "thinking", "hungry" and "eating" which are represented by different values in their respective znode.

The waiter also has a znode to indicate whether the philosopher can eat or not.
When a philosopher wants to eat, they check if they are hungry and if the two chopsticks on either side of them are available.

If both chopsticks are available and the waiter permits it, they change their state to "eating".
If one or more of the chopsticks are not available or the waiter does not permit it, they remain in the "hungry" state.

Once a philosopher finishes eating, they release the chopsticks and change their state back to "thinking".
Whenever a philosopher changes their state, they update their respective znode in Zookeeper.
The waiter listens for changes in the philosophers' znodes, and whenever a philosopher changes their state to "hungry", the waiter checks if both chopsticks are available.
If both chopsticks are available, the waiter grants permission to the philosopher by changing the value of the philosopher's znode to "eating".
If both chopsticks are not available, the waiter denies permission by leaving the philosopher's znode as "hungry".
This algorithm uses Zookeeper's coordination service to ensure that only one philosopher is eating at a time, and it avoids deadlocks by having the waiter act as a central authority to grant permission to the philosophers to eat.
