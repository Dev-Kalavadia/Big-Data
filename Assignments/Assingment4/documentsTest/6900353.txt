Title: Frankston High School



Frankston High School (abbreviated as FHS) or simply Frankston High, is a government-funded co-educational high school, located in , Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The school offers education for students from Year 7 to Year 12.

==School profile==
Frankston High School is a large multi-campus co-educational facility situated in Frankston South. The Year 7 to 10 and Senior School (Years 11 and 12) campuses occupy sites across from one another.

The school has formed a partnership, the Frankston Federation of Schools, with the main neighbourhood primary schools Derinya, Overport, Frankston and Frankston Heights. Through this federation, staff and resources are shared. A transition program helps students adjust from primary to secondary school.

In 2006 a Tablet PC programme was launched, which created two "streams" for students to take either tablet, or non-tablet classes from the commencement of Year 7 onwards. The tablet programme was for students to use technology every day in all classes for their education. In 2015, the two streams were merged, and it was made compulsory for all students to purchase a Windows Surface Pro prior to commencing Year 7, as part of their school resources.

Frankston High School was ranked 16th out of all state secondary schools in Victoria based on VCE results in 2018.

==Sustainability==
An updated school sustainability policy was ratified by the school's parent council in late 2014.

In 2015 the St Kilda Eco Centre awarded students in the Eco Team a scholarship to participate in a Polperro Dolphin Swim, recognizing their investigation of micro-plastics at Frankston foreshore.

==Languages==
