Title: North-East Region, Singapore

The North-East Region of Singapore is one of the five regions in the country. The region is the most densely populated and has the highest population among the five, with Sengkang being its most populous town as of 2020 and Seletar as the regional centre. Comprising 13,810 hectares, it includes seven planning areas and is largely a residential region with 217,120 homes. Housing largely consists of high-density HDB public housing estates, however private housing is also present in the region. As its name implies, it is located in the north-eastern part of Singapore.http://www.ura.gov.sg/DMP2008/northeast.htm

The North-East Region, along with the four other planning regions, was officially established by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1999. Prior to the 1970s, the region was predominantly rural and experienced very little urbanisation. It was only with the development of towns such as Ang Mo Kio and Hougang over the next few decades that the region began to grow significantly in population and experienced dramatic urban development. As of 2020, the North-East Region has a population of 930,910. While predominantly a residential region, the North-East Region is also home to tourist attractions, such as Pulau Ubin and Coney Island. The region has a number of hospitals, parks, educational facilities, and security and defence services. There are also a variety of transport options, including Mass Rapid Transit, Light Rail Transit and public bus services, facilitating transport within and outside the region.

== History ==
Before the 1960s, the North-East Region was primarily made up of farmland and rainforest. At this time the majority of urbanisation in Singapore was concentrated in the southern part of the country, where the Central Region is now located. The first Master Plan was adopted in 1958. The Master Plan was a statutory plan which regulated land use and development over a 20-year period, to be reviewed every five years. One of the main aims of this plan was to establish New Towns away from the Central Region, laying the precedent for the North-East Region’s urban development. However, this plan was soon deemed inefficient and not flexible enough to accommodate the rapid demographic and economic development in Singapore. In 1971 the Concept Plan was introduced, a more long-term plan which rather than providing a detailed guide for urban planning, it simply provided a general direction for development over the next 40 to 50 years. These two combined planning processes (The Master Plan and the Concept Plan) continue to be revised every few years, led by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. 

It was over the next few decades that towns within the North East Region were built up. The first new towns were Ang Mo Kio and Hougang. Ang Mo Kio New Town began development in 1973 and Hougang in 1979. Up until the 1990s, the North-East Region was included as part of the Rural Planning Area. This area consisted of most of the land outside of the Central Planning Area. However, under the 1991 Concept Plan, the country was officially organised into five regions, along with 55 subdivision. Thus, the North East Region was established. This system allowed for more area specific planning and detailed land use guides.

==Geography==
Situated at the northeastern corner of Singapore Island, the region comprises a total land area of , including the North-Eastern cluster of islands, Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Tekong Kechil. It borders Singapore's East Region to the east, Central Region to the south and North Region to the west.

==Government==
The North-East Region is governed locally by four different Community Development Councils, namely the Central CDC, North East CDC, North West CDC and South East CDC.

===Planning Areas===

== Housing ==
thumb|HDB housing estates in Punggol
The North-East Region is predominantly a residential area. Like other regions outside the city centre, towns in the North-East Region are largely made up of high-density, high-rise public housing, provided by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). HDB estates make up 78.72% of households in the region. Each of these housing developments are designed for self-sufficiency, with schools, hospitals, parks, sports facilities, shopping malls and other amenities easily available to residents. The North-East Region experiences continual development of housing and other public facilities. New housing in Ang Mo Kio, Hougang and Serangoon is being developed, along with new transport options, parks and other amenities. In recent years, the HDB has also developed more of a focus on sustainability and incorporating ecological considerations into town planning. The town of Punggol was branded as the “first eco-town”, with more greenery incorporated into the area, along with the development of the Punggol Promenade and Waterway.

While the majority of housing in the region is still public, some have noted that there has also been an increase in private housing in the North East Region. Excluding the Central Region, the North East Region accounted for 40.3% of all private residential sales transactions in Singapore in 2019.
