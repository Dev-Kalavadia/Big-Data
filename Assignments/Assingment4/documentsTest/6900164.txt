Title: Undead (Ten Years After album)



Undead is a live album by Ten Years After, recorded at the small jazz club, Klooks Kleek, in London, May 1968, and released in July of that year. The show combined blues, boogie and jazz playing that merged more traditional rock and roll with 1950s-style jump blues. The album "amply illustrates" Alvin Lee's "eclectic" use of the pentatonic scale mixed with other modalities.
