==Career==

In 1992, he joined Télé Liban as a news reporter and late-night news anchor. Soon afterwards, he became Télé Liban’s face for news through its promotional campaign Aban An Jad, by Saatchi & Saatchi . In 1994, he was assigned to be TL's news correspondent at the Presidential Palace in Baabda. He started his first weekly talk show, "5/7" in 1995, and his investigative journalism made him a household name in Lebanon.  Within the show's first year, Zaven was making headlines through the controversial issues he investigated, such as the toxic wastes scandal, the Israeli kidnapping of Mustafa Dirani, and the ban of the Lebanese Forces."5/7" became Télé Liban's longest-running talk show in the 1990s, scoring the highest rating for a single talk show episode in 1996.

During his coverage of the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath offensive on South Lebanon in 1996, Zaven rose to prominence as he brought the horrifying footage of the Israeli massacres at the Qana and Mansouri villages to global attention.Harb, Z., ["Covering the Qana 'Massacre' 1996: A Case of Contextual Objectivity"], Middle East Journal of Culture and Communication, 1 (2008)

In 1999, and during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, the pro-Syrian government under Selim Hoss banned 5/7 from airing on Télé Liban. Zaven shaved his head as an expression of protest.

Seven months later, Zaven moved to Future Television, a television broadcasting network owned by former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.  He started his own show, Siré Wenfatahit, which quickly became the highest-rated talk show in the Middle East, according to Pan-Arab IPTV network Talfazat-ART.  In 2004, Zaven convinced four HIV-positive individuals to appear on his show about life after AIDS and discrimination. This was the first time that HIV-positive individuals appeared on any Arab channel without covering their faces.  Also in 2004, he published his first book, Lebanon Shot Twice.  Inspired by Oprah Winfrey, he launched the first Arab television book club, the Nisrine Jaber Book Club.Sakr, Naomi, ["Arab Television Today"] (London: I.B. Tauris, 2007) p. 53,160

Zaven often opened his show as a platform for political and social activism. "An episode of talk show Sireh w’infatahit aired by Future TV on December 19th 2005 had the presenter Zaven  Kouyoumdjian offer to bring members of the opposition and Hizbolla to the studio to air their views and reach a common ground".Khatib, L. "Television and Public Action in the Beirut Spring"  (Stanford, 2007), p.21

In 2005, Zaven was named by Newsweek magazine in 2005 as one of the 43 most influential people in the Middle East.

Zaven launched a new series, called Ana Ala'an (meaning Me Now) in 2006. The series aimed at giving the chance for Arab youth to express their thoughts and feelings on TV using their personal camera. This series is credited to be the first recognition of emerging online media and the power of youth to achieve change. Zaven ended his 13-year-long show Sire Wenfatahit on July 15, 2012, in a special series of countdown episodes.

In August 2012, Zaven kicked off his show AalAkid on Future TV, a collaboration with director Bassem Christo and French producer Péri Cochin through their production house Periba. The show was a Lebanese adaptation of the popular French show Sans aucun doute, presented by Julien Courbet daily on TMC. AalAkid was received by critics and viewers with enthusiasm, as it reshaped the Lebanese social talk show experience and established new foundations for conflict resolution through media.  The show gained quick appreciation as a new style in addressing social issues on Lebanese television.https://aljaras.com/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AE%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84/

In September 2019, shortly before celebrating his 20th anniversary at Future TV, the station ceased all its production operations due to financial losses, and thus Zaven’s show Bala Toul Sire was terminated.

==Publications==
*Lebanon Shot Twice is a best-seller book since 2003. A second edition of the book was issued in 2005, and a third in 2009. This trilingual (Arabic / English / French) gift book contains a collection of photos of people and places taken during the Lebanese civil war (1975 – 1990) in a before and after format. The stories accompanying the photos tell the inspiring stories of the victims and survivors of Lebanon's 15-year-long war. The book was the culmination of Kouyoumdjian's teenage hobby of collecting newspaper and magazine cutouts. After decades of collecting pictures and photographs, Zaven went out on a two-year quest of searching for the locations and people featured in these pictures. He documented the change they went through nearly a decade and half after the end of the civil war. Zaven described his books as neither a war book nor a history book, but a documentation and retelling of personal stories through a chaotic period of time. The book was launched in huge exhibitions and books signings in several cities including Dubai, Amman, Manama, and Kuwait City. A fourth edition of the book was published by Hachette Antoine publishing house in 2019.
*Witness on Society (Arabic – published by Academia 2012) is based on a decade-long television social talk show experience between Future TV and Tele Liban.

It features real-life stories and narrations from viewers who live those issues and shared them on television. The book spans an expansive array of topics including depression, trauma, anxiety, sexual identity issues, sexual harassment, emotional and social intelligence, marital relations, spinsterhood, and suicide, among many others.http://zavenonline.info/a-witness-on-the-society.php?lang=en
