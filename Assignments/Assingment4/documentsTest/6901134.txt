Title: Diamonds and Pearls Video Collection


Diamonds and Pearls Video Collection is a collection of music videos compiled to accompany and further promote Prince's hit album Diamonds and Pearls.  The collection was originally released in VHS format on October 6, 1992, and finally saw a DVD release on August 22, 2006 (the same release date as Prince's Ultimate collection). The collection contains videos for most of the songs on the album, with the exception of "Daddy Pop", "Walk, Don't Walk" and "Push". Two tracks included that were not on the album were "Call the Law", which was a B-side to the single release of "Money Don't Matter 2 Night" and "Dr. Feelgood", a cover version. Four of the clips were live concert performances: "Thunder", "Dr. Feelgood", "Jughead" and "Live 4 Love". The DVD release did not contain any extras from the VHS version.
