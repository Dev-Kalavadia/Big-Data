Title: CrazyShow


CrazyShow is a limited-edition (2500 copies) four-CD album by Alphaville, composed of new material as well
as rare and remixed tracks, and three cover versions ("Do the Strand" by Roxy Music, "Something" by George Harrison", and "Diamonds Are Forever" by Don Black and John Barry). It's considered to be a sequel to the eight-CD album Dreamscapes, and as such the discs are numbered from 9 to 12.

Between October 2000 and October 2001, Alphaville released – free of charge – an average of one track per month on their official website. All of those tracks ended up on CrazyShow, though some were remixed. The internet releases were: "Scum of the Earth", "MoonGirl", "MoonBoy", "See Me Thru", "Those Wonderful Things", "And as for Love", "Upside Down", "Parallel Girlz (Cloud Nine)", 
"Shadows She Said (Omerta)", "First Monday (in the year 3000)", "(Waiting for the) New Light", "Miracle Healing", "Zoo" and "On the Beach".

A single CD promotional version of the set called CrazyShow Excerpts was also released.
