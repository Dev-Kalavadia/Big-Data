Title: 2006 Swedish general election computer infringement affair
The 2006 Swedish election espionage affair, in daily media sometimes called Leijongate, which is created from Watergate and the liberal party leader Lars Leijonborg, was a series of computer break-ins and the subsequent scandal. It all started on September 4, 2006, only weeks before the 2006 general election, the Social Democratic Party reported a computer break-in into the Social Democrats' internal network to the police. It has been reported that members of the Liberal People's Party had copied secret information not yet officially released to counter-attack Social Democratic political propositions on at least two occasions.
