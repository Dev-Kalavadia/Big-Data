Title: Lesotho national cricket team




The Lesotho national cricket team is the team that represents Lesotho in international cricket. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001 and an associate member in 2017.

Lesotho has played international cricket since at least 1986, when they played Swaziland in Maseru. They made their official ICC debut at Division Three of the Africa Region of the ICC World Cricket League in April 2006, where they came last in the eight-team tournament. 

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Lesotho and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.
