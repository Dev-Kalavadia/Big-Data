Title: Fergal McCormack



Fergal McCormack (born 17 December 1974) is an Irish hurling coach and former hurler. He played for North Cork club Mallow and was a member of the Cork senior hurling team for eight seasons, during which time he usually lined out at centre-forward.

McCormack began his hurling career at club level with Mallow. He broke onto the club's top adult team as a 17-year-old in 1992 before later winning a Cork Under-21 Championship with the Mallow under-21 football team. McCormack made 57 championship appearances in three different grades of hurling for the club, while his early prowess also saw him selected for the Avondhu divisional team, with whom he won the Cork Senior Championship title in 1996.

At inter-county level, Landers enjoyed an unsuccessful tenure with the Cork minor and under-21 teams before later winning an All-Ireland Championship with the junior team in 1994. He joined the Cork senior team in 1995. From his debut, McCormack was ever-present as a midfielder or centre-forward and made a combined total of 48 National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 2002. During that time he was part of the All-Ireland Championship-winning team in 1999. McCormack also secured two Munster Championship medals and a National Hurling League medal. After leaving the Cork senior team in 2002 he returned to the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry senior hurling team in 2008.

At inter-provincial level, McCormack was selected to play in two championship campaigns with Munster, however, his tenure with the team ended with a Railway Cup medal.

McCormack's appearance for Cork were limited to just two during the 2001 National League. He was ruled out of Cork's subsequent Munster Championship campaign due to a leg injury.

Cork qualified for the 2002 National League final on 5 May, with McCormack starting on the bench as he had done for all of Cork's league games that season. In the week leading up to the game there had been speculation that Gaelic Players Association members from both teams would stage a protest during the parade before the match with their socks down and jerseys out - offences punishable by fine under the GAA's match regulations. The Cork players went ahead with their pre-match protest before losing the final by 2-15 to 2-14. McCormack played his last game for Cork on 26 May when he lined out at centre-forward in Cork's 1-16 to 1-15 defeat by Waterford in the Munster Championship. He was an unused substitute for the rest of Cork's unsuccessful championship campaign. On 21 August, McCormack gave an interview on 96FM in which he stated that the players were treated as "second-class citizens." He went on to say: "There is almost a them and us attitude between players and officials and the perception that we are only players. I have been involved in the panel since 1995 and that problem has always been there. Players of the past have, I know from talking to them, felt the same way but did not really come out and said anything about it." The dissatisfaction between the players and the Cork County Board culminated with all 30 members of the Cork panel were withdrawing their services from the county in the hope of better treatment from the county board on 29 November. McCormack played a low-key role during the negotiations over the following two weeks before a settlement was reached on 13 December. While the player's demands were met, McCormack never played for Cork again.

===Kerry===

On 12 April 2008, it was announced that McCormack declared for [Kerry under the rule which allows up to five "outside" players to join weaker hurling counties. He was also eligible to play for the team under the parentage rule. McCormack was an unused substitute throughout Kerry's unsuccessful Christy Ring Cup campaign and left the panel at the end of the season.

===Munster===

McCormack was selected for the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time during the 1998 Railway Cup. He made his first appearance on 8 November when he came on as a substitute in a 2-15 to 0-09 defeat by Leinster.

McCormack was selected for the Munster team again the following year and was included on the starting fifteen. On 25 November 1999, he lined out at centre-forward when Munster suffered a 2-23 to 1-15 defeat by Connacht in the final.
