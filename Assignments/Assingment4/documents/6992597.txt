==Career==
Forinton was born in Boston, Lincolnshire. He began his football career as an apprentice at Oxford United, but was released at the end of his apprenticeship. He joined Abingdon Town and, after a short spell at Oxford City, he joined Yeovil Town where he scored 23 goals in just 25 matches. His prolific scoring soon caught the eye of Birmingham City boss Trevor Francis, who paid £75,000 for him. He made very few first-team appearances but finished as top scorer for Birmingham's reserve team in both of his seasons at the club. While at Birmingham City he went on loan to both Plymouth Argyle and Blackpool.

In November 1999, he signed for Peterborough United for £250,000. However, after a number of injuries he failed to impress. He looked set to join Plymouth Argyle in July 2000, but remained with Peterborough and joined Yeovil Town on loan in 2001.

Forinton moved to Torquay United on a free transfer in August 2002, signing on a non-contract basis, and made just one appearance, in which he set up a goal, before the club decided not to offer him a further deal. He returned to Yeovil on a monthly contract later the same month, but was released in November 2002 while awaiting operations on both ankles. He joined Oxford City the following month, and then moved to Stevenage Borough in June 2003, but was released in September 2003 and returned to Oxford City the following month.

In November 2003 Forinton moved to Farnborough Town. He then moved to Banbury United in June 2004, leaving to join Halesowen Town in May 2005. After one season at Halesowen he re-signed for Banbury in May 2006. In October 2006 he rejected a move to Bath City, opting to stay at Banbury to take on a player/coach role in the club.

Forinton left Banbury United after the departure of manager Kevin Brock to join Redditch United in June 2007, but rejoined Banbury United in October 2008.

At the end of 2009, Forinton left Banbury United for Woodford United in the Southern League Midlands Division, to pursue a player/coach role. After a spell with Daventry Town, Forinton returned to Banbury United for the 2012–13 season in a player/coach capacity before departing just two months later after the playing budget was cut. Forinton returned to Woodford United having taken up his first managerial post, in 2012. However, he resigned in November 2012 after only two months in the job, and was one of many Woodford managers during the 2012–13 season which culminated in their relegation from the Southern Football League in 2013 with the unwanted record of having lost all 42 matches.2012–13 Southern Football League
