Title: Conoid

300px|thumb|Right circular conoid:  

In geometry a conoid () is a ruled surface, whose rulings (lines) fulfill the additional conditions:
:(1) All rulings are parallel to a plane, the directrix plane.
:(2) All rulings intersect a fixed line, the axis.
 
The conoid is a right conoid if its axis is perpendicular to its directrix plane. Hence all rulings are perpendicular to the axis.

Because of (1) any conoid is a Catalan surface and can be represented parametrically by 
:\mathbf x(u,v)= \mathbf c(u) + v\mathbf r(u)\  
Any curve  with fixed parameter  is a ruling,  describes the directrix and the vectors  are  all parallel to the directrix plane. The planarity of the vectors  can be represented by 
:\det(\mathbf r,\mathbf \dot r,\mathbf \ddot r)=0 .
If the directrix is a circle, the conoid is called a circular conoid.

The term conoid was already used by Archimedes in his treatise On Conoids and Spheroides.

== Examples ==

=== Right circular conoid ===
The parametric representation
: \mathbf x(u,v)=(\cos u,\sin u,0) + v (0,-\sin u,z_0) \ ,\ 0\le u <2\pi, v\in \R
:describes a right circular conoid with the unit circle of the x-y-plane as directrix and a directrix plane, which is parallel to the y--z-plane. Its axis is the line (x,0,z_0) \ x\in \R \ .

Special features: 
# The intersection with a horizontal plane is an ellipse.
# (1-x^2)(z-z_0)^2-y^2z_0^2=0 is an implicit representation. Hence the right circular conoid is a surface of degree 4. 
# Kepler's rule gives for a right circular conoid  with radius r and height h the exact volume:  V=\tfrac{\pi}{2}r^2h.

The implicit representation is fulfilled by the points of the line (x,0,z_0), too. For these points there exist no tangent planes. Such points are called singular.

=== Parabolic conoid ===

The parametric representation
: \mathbf x(u,v)=\left(1,u,-u^2\right)+ v\left(-1,0,u^2\right)
:::: =\left(1-v,u,-(1-v)u^2\right)\ , u,v \in \R \ ,
describes a parabolic conoid with the equation  z=-xy^2. The conoid has a parabola as directrix, the y-axis as axis and a plane parallel to the x-z-plane as directrix plane. It is used by architects as roof surface (s. below).

The parabolic conoid has no singular points.

=== Mathematics ===
There are a lot of conoids with singular points, which are investigated in algebraic geometry.

=== Architecture ===
Like other ruled surfaces conoids are of high interest with architects, because they can be built using beams or bars. Right conoids can be manufactured easily: one threads bars onto an axis such that they can be rotated around this axis, only. Afterwards one deflects the bars by a directrix and generates a conoid (s. parabolic conoid).
