The Reichsgericht (, Reich Court) was the supreme criminal and civil court in the German Reich from 1879 to 1945. It was based in Leipzig, Germany. The Supreme Court was established when the Reichsjustizgesetze (Imperial Justice Laws) came into effect and it built a widely regarded body of jurisprudence during the period of the German Empire and Weimar Republic."Federal Court of Justice Celebrates 50th Anniversary", German Law Journal, November 2000

During the rise of the Third Reich, the Reichsgericht became deeply embroiled in the National Socialist agenda. It even involved itself in matters of Nazi Matrimonial and Contract Law before enactment of the Nuremberg Laws.Fundstelle: Entscheidungen des Reichsgerichts in Zivilsachen p. 147, 65, 68 During and after the Nazi period it received criticism for the ease, and even willingness, with which it provided the highest level of formal legal justification for Nazi programs."Federal Court of Justice Celebrates 50th Anniversary", German Law Journal, November 2000 Immediately after the end of World War II, the Reichsgericht was dissolved, and reformed into the German High Court for the Unified Economic Region (Trizone), the Allied occupation zones of France, the United Kingdom and the United States.
