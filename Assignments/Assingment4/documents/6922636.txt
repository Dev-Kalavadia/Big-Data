==Early life==
Gedong was born with the name Ni Wayan Gedong in Karangasem as the daughter of the couple I Komang Layang and Ni Komang Pupuh, a member of the village council. Unlike most females at the time, the young Gedong was given the freedom by her parents to undertake all of her wishes. She was allowed to go to school. So she went to study in Yogyakarta and Jakarta.

At school in Yogyakarta, she had the liberty to study Christianity. Her understanding about Christianity and her birth in the Hindu tradition caused her to befriend Mahatma Gandhi. They discussed Christian and Hindu philosophy.Ramstedt, Martin (2000) Gedong Bagoes Oka. IIAS Newsletter.

The understanding about these two religions made her a follower of Hindu spirit, that is  (non violence) and satya (truth).
