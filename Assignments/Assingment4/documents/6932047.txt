Title: Sakkuth



Sakkuth is an Australian melodic metal band formed in Brisbane, Queensland in 1998. They describe themselves as "melodic metal". The band was active in the Brisbane heavy metal scene and around Australia for nearly 10 years.

==Members==

===The beginning===
Sakkuth was created by Adam Merker (guitars '94-'05) and Moises Contreras (vocals '94-present). Craig Hollywood was hired as second guitar, Wolfgang on Keyboard, Scott Ward on Drums and various Bass players tried to fill the slot while the band found its feet. After performing with this line-up the decision was made to look into other line up options. A number of line-up changes later, Scott McIvor was hired for lead guitar, Damien Biggers was poached from a local band after impressing Adam with his drumming on his previous band's demo. Lindal Loakes joined the band almost by accident and the lineup became complete. The first EP was recorded at "Soul Studios" on the Gold Coast in Queensland by Adam Keane (guitarist and producer of SoundSurgery). This independent release was well received by both fans and radio with the first song from the EP "Time and Sweet Nectar" receiving continual air time on "JJJ's" three hours of power and the evergrowing crowds at live shows. This track was also included on a JJJ metal compilation receiving national distribution.

After writing the songs for the first full-length "Quest from within" Sakkuth guitarist Adam Merker started Studio Anders Debeerz for the specific purpose of recording the band's music.

===Previous Members===
Lindal Loakes left the band prior to writing "Quest from Within" citing creative differences as the reason.

In Late 2005 Guitarist and co-founder, Adam Merker, left the band to spend more time with his family and to concentrate on his career as a producer/engineer (Studio Anders Debeerz).
