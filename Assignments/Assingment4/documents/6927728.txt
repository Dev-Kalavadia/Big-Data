Title: The Secret Book of Gnomes


The Secret Book of Gnomes is a series of books about gnomes designed for children. They contain fictional stories and guides about how gnomes live in harmony with their environment, such as what a gnome has in his first aid kit and how a gnome's house is built. The books were written by the Dutch author Wil Huygen and illustrator Rien Poortvliet, though they have claimed that parts were written by a gnome called David. Those authors also created another series about gnomes entitled The Gnomes. 
That later was used as a basis for the television shows David the Gnome and Wisdom of the Gnomes by BRB Internacional.
