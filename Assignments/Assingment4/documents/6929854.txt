Title: List of Northern Ireland ministers, government departments and executive agencies

A list of Northern Ireland government departments, their agencies and their ministers and related organisations.
The devolved government of Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Executive) is responsible for most public services in the region but some services are also provided by the United Kingdom Government and cross-border bodies under the North/South Ministerial Council.  Public bodies take several forms with some reporting directly to their department (agencies) and others operating having more independence as they advise government (non-departmental public bodies).Departments, agencies and NDPBs, Home Civil Service, 15 November 2009 

Below the regional tier of public bodies, public services are also provided by 11 local authorities, one educational authority and five health and social care trusts.  Others are accountable directly to the Northern Ireland Assembly or to external organisations, like the European Union.
