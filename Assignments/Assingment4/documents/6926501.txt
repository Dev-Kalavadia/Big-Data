 Marko Maksimović  (Serbian Cyrillic: Марко Максимовић; born 20 August 1984) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player who is the manager of Bosnian Premier League club Leotar.

==Club career==
Maksimović played youth football in the Džaja football school in his hometown of Banja Luka. His professional career started at another Banja Luka club - FK Borac. He is considered to have been a very creative and hard-working midfielder which secured him a place in the Bosnia and Herzegovina U21 national team.

He played for NK Zagreb and Istra 1961 in the Croatian Prva HNL.

Maksimović signed with Sarajevo in July 2007. He scored his first goal for the team against Marsaxlokk in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers on 18 July 2007. Afterwards, he played 6 months with Leotar before returning to Borac in January 2009, and retiring there three years later in 2012.

==International career==
Maksimović was a member of the Bosnia and Herzegovina U21 national team.

==Managerial career==
Maksimović started off his managerial career at BSK Banja Luka in 2015, staying there until 2017. He was then caretaker manager of Borac Banja Luka for one game in March 2018.

On 26 December 2020, Maksimović came back to Borac, this time as a permanent manager, replacing Vlado Jagodić. In his first game as manager, Borac beat Olimpik in a league match on 27 February 2021. Maksimović oversaw his first loss as manager in a league game against Velež Mostar, played on 5 March 2021. In the end however, he managed to guide Borac to a Bosnian Premier League title one game before the end of the 2020–21 season, their first after 10 years.
