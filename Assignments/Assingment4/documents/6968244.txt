Title: Sarratt


Sarratt is both a village and a civil parish in Three Rivers District, Hertfordshire, England. It is situated   north of Rickmansworth on high ground near the county boundary with Buckinghamshire. The chalk stream, the River Chess, rising just north of Chesham in the Chiltern Hills, passes through Sarratt Bottom in the valley to the west of the village to join the River Colne in Rickmansworth. The conditions offered by the river are perfect for the cultivation of watercress. Sarratt has the only commercially operating watercress farm in Hertfordshire. The valley to the east of Sarratt is dry.

== Church and chapel ==
The parish church of Sarratt is the Church of the Holy Cross. Founded , construction is flint-and-brick built with, reputedly, reused Roman tiles.

From the 17th century a large linear village developed nearly  away. Nowadays, this area is referred to as Sarratt Green and the area around the church is known as Church End.
The village also included a Baptist Chapel and an independent Providence Mission Hall; both closed and converted into private residences.

== Motorway ==
When the M25 London orbital motorwaywidened in 2011 to eight lanes (four each way)was opened, the rural atmosphere of Sarratt changed.  Where it passes Sarratt, it is less than   distant at its nearest point, the bridge carrying Sarratt Road.

Junction 18 (M25) is on the Chorleywood Road (the A404) only  by road from the village.

Sarratt's Church of England school, situated near the junction of Church Lane and The Green, is the village's primary school with 160170 pupils. In December 2015 Ofsted inspected the school and judged it to be good across the board, having been rated inadequate since December 2014.

Sarratt Ducklings, an independent pre-school for children aged from 2 to 4, located in the grounds of Sarratt Primary School, is a registered charity. It was judged outstanding by Ofsted in 2015.
