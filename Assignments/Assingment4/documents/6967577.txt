Title: William Bernard Ziff Jr.

William Bernard "Bill" Ziff Jr. (June 24, 1930 â€“ September 9, 2006) was an American publishing executive. His father, William Bernard Ziff Sr., was the co-founder of Ziff Davis Inc. and when the elder Ziff died in 1953, Ziff took over the management of the company. After buying out partner Bernard G. Davis, he led Ziff Davis to become the most successful publisher of technology magazines in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Biography==
He was born on June 24, 1930 to Bill Ziff Sr., a Jewish American publishing executive, author, and vocal proponent of Revisionist Zionism, and his second wife, Amelia Mary Morton. He was mainly raised in Miami, and then moved with his family to Sarasota, in 1947. A polymath with a photographic memory, he graduated from Rutgers University in 1951, then studied philosophy in West Germany. In 1953, after the death of his father, he moved to New York City to lead Ziff Davis Inc. Four years later, he bought out co-founder Bernard Davis, who then launched Davis Publications Inc. Ziff then re-directed the company toward enthusiast magazines and trade publications, with the acquisition of such titles as Car and Driver, Popular Electronics, PC Magazine, World Aviation Directory and Computer Shopper.Sarasota Herald Tribune: "Magazine publisher Ziff remembered in Sarasota" by Latisha R.

By focusing on enthusiast and trade publications, Ziff's salesmen were able to directly target advertisers who wanted to market to a specific audience. His approach was very successful: manufacturers and retailers were eager to advertise in his magazines at a time when general-interest publications were largely suffering from declining advertising sales.

In 1978, Ziff was diagnosed with prostate cancer, with a prognosis of only a few years to live. In 1984, he sold most of the consumer and business magazines for US$712.5 million keeping a few computer titles like PC Magazine. His computer magazines pioneered the format of conducting sophisticated technical tests of computer products; as a result, their reviews would often make or break the introduction of new personal computers, modems, or CD-ROM drives. During the rapid-growth genesis of personal computing, Ziff Davis quickly became the dominant computer publishing firm in the world.Los Angeles Times: "Forstmann Little Buys Ziff Publishing Empire : Media: Price of $1.4 billion is less than what had reportedly been sought. PC Magazine is among the properties" by Ray Delgado October 28, 1994 Ziff had wanted to turn the business over to his sons- Daniel, Dirk and Robert -but they did not desire the responsibility. In 1994, he announced the sale of the publishing group to Forstmann Little & Company for US$1.4 billion.The New York Times: "Forstmann To Acquire Ziff-Davis" October 28, 1994 The sale of the electronic publishing unit occurred later.
