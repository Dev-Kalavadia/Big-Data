Title: Black Gold: The Best of Soul Asylum

Black Gold: The Best of Soul Asylum is the second compilation album by Soul Asylum. It contains 19 of their greatest hits.

The title of the album comes from Soul Asylum's song of the same name, which was a hit single from their 1992 breakthrough album Grave Dancers Union.

The disc contains two outtakes ("Candy from a Stranger" and "Lonely for You") from Soul Asylum's previous album Candy from a Stranger, as well as two previously unreleased live recordings ("Closer to the Stars" and "Stranger").
