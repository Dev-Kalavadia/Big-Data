He was working as an assistant to the editor of The New York Times Book Review when in January 1956 he was forced to testify before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, chaired by James O. Eastland, after being fingered in fellow journalist Winston Burdett's testimony. Aleskovsky had worked for the Times for five years at the time he was subpoenaed in November 1955.
