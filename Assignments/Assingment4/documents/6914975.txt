===Army of West Virginia (VIII Corps)===
BG George CrookWelcher, The Union Army, 1861–1865 Organization and Operations. Vol. 1, p. 420 notes that Crook's army consisted in part of troops that formerly belonged to the VIII Corps, of the Middle Department, so that name was sometimes used because it was less cumbersome than Army of West Virginia. The official name of the organization, established by order on August 8, 1864, was Army of West Virginia. Lewis, The Guns of Cedar Creek, p. 107, notes that this grand title disguised the fact that the 4,000 men of the so-called army were the approximate size of a Union division, and their two constituent divisions were actually brigade-sized and led by colonels.
