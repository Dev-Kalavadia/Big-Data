Title: Virginia Film Festival



The Virginia Film Festival is a film festival hosted by the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The festival is held annually, usually in late October or early November.

== History ==

Created in October 1988, the Virginia Festival of American Film (renamed The Virginia Film Festival) was endorsed by the state's Department of Economic Development and adopted by the University of Virginia. The intent was twofold: to stimulate economic development by encouraging film production in Virginia and increasing tourism, and to meld the creative interests and crafts of the American film industry with the intellectual resources of a nationally ranked university.

In 1996, the festival was affiliated with the drama department of the University of Virginia.  In 2002, the Festival moved to the Dean's office in the College of Arts and Science and then to the media studies department.  The Festival's focus was expanded to encompass a broader range of international films, year-round programs, and a very active Film Society that presents films and guest speakers at the downtown Vinegar Hill Theatre.

The first two premieres at the festival were Child's Play and Mystic Pizza.

In 2009, Jody Kielbasa, the founding director of the Sarasota Film Festival, was brought on as the new director of the Virginia Film Festival.

From 1990 through 2009, Virginia Film Festival chose a different theme each year on which to base its film program. Past themes are listed below.  Starting in 2010, the Festival announced its intention to leave the themed approach in favor of more flexible programming. The VAFF celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2012.
