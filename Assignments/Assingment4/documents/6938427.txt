Achille Richard was a French botanist, botanical illustrator and physician (27 April 1794 in Paris – 5 October 1852). 

== Biography ==

Achille was the son of the botanist Louis-Claude Marie Richard (1754–1821). He was a pharmacist in the French navy, and a member of several well-known societies of that time. He became a botanical leader, and his books remain valued for their clarity and precision.

On 24 February 1834 he was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences (Botanical Section). He was also a member of the French National Academy of Medicine. He studied and described several genera of orchids that take his abbreviation in the generic name, among them Ludisia.
