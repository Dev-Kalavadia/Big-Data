Title: Déformation professionnelle

Déformation professionnelle (, professional deformation or job conditioning) is a tendency to look at things from the point of view of one's own profession or special expertise, rather than from a broader or humane perspective. It is often translated as "professional deformation", though French déformation can also be translated as "distortion". The implication is that professional training, and its related socialization, often result in a distortion of the way one views the world.Julia Bönisch, "Déformation professionnelle: Beruflich bedingte Missbildung" Süddeutsche Zeitung (November 30, 2007). Retrieved March 5, 2011  The Nobel laureate Alexis Carrel has observed that "[e]very specialist, owing to a well-known professional bias, believes that he understands the entire human being, while in reality he only grasps a tiny part of him."

==History==

"Déformation professionnelle" was used in 19th-century medicine to describe a bodily deformity caused by one's occupation.Morel-Lavallée, "Sur une fausse 'dent d'Hutchinson'; déformation professionnelle chez un cordonnier" 'On a false Hutchinson's tooth: occupational deformity in a shoemaker' Annales de Dermatologie et de Syphiligraphie 8:5:339 (1887)

As a term in psychology, it was likely introduced by the Belgian sociologist , or the Russian-American sociologist Pitirim Sorokin.

The colloquial term nerdview describes a similar tendency.
