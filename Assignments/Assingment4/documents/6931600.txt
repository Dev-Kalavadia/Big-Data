Title: List of Danionin species by common nameSince 2004 many new Danionins have been discovered which do not yet have scientific names and many other species, previously known only to the scientific fraternity, have become available in Aquarist Shops. This has predictably led to total confusion as to the naming of some fish, with some species having up to five different common names in use and some common names being used for up to four different species.

All common names currently in use for Danionins are listed below in Alphabetical Order. Click on the common name for the correct identity and further details of each fish. The suffix danio is almost always used for common names although the suffix Devario is sometimes in practice used for Danionins in the genus Devario.
