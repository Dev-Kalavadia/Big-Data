Title: Another Happy Ending



Another Happy Ending is the sixth album by Pittsburgh band The Clarks. The band's popularity continued to spread following the release of this album, as rock stations in Buffalo and Reading, Pennsylvania begin playing the record's lead single. However, Pittsburgh remained as the band's core fan base. The first single, "Hey You," was a highly emotional, beautifully constructed song. Its sad, yet hopeful lyrics were inspired by the horrors of September 11, specifically the many World Trade Center workers who dove to their deaths from upper floors of the building. The other two hit songs were more upbeat—the mid-tempo "Boys Lie" and the excellent rhythm guitar song "On Saturday."
