Title: Blanks 77

Blanks 77 is an American punk rock band active from 1990 to 2001, and again from 2004 onward. Originally based in Hillside, New Jersey, they have since relocated to Denville.

The band has maintained a prolific career, having released three albums and numerous EPs, appeared on numerous compilations, toured Europe twice, the U.S. countless times, and shared the stage with other well-known punk acts such as the Misfits, Rancid, Dwarves, the Business, Bad Brains, the Bouncing Souls, One Way System, Anti-Nowhere League, Anti-Heros, Dropkick Murphys, GBH, the Criminals, UK Subs, and Total Chaos.

==History==
===Formation, early years, first record (1990–1996)===
The band formed in 1990 when high school friends Mike (vocals) and Chad (drums) were joined by guitarist Renee, whom they had met through a musician wanted ad. Their first bassist was a friend of Renee's named Brendan.  The new group named themselves the Blanks after finding their minds blank as to what to name the band. Shortly thereafter, another band informed them that the Blanks name was already taken; to avoid conflict, they added '77 to their name in reference to punk rock's canonically accepted year of origin.

The original line-up remained until Brendan left in 1992. He was replaced by Geoff Kresge, who left the band after a six-month tenure to rejoin his band AFI. (Kresge would later go on to play in Tiger Army and HorrorPops.)  He was replaced in Blanks 77 by Tim from the Broken Heroes, who began performing live with the band after a single rehearsal.  The band recorded their first album, Killer Blanks, which was released first in Germany on the Nasty Vinyl label in 1995, and in the U.S. a year later in 1996 on Radical Records with four extra tracks.

===Further releases, lineup changes and breakup (1997–2001)===
In 1997 Blanks 77 released a second album, Tanked and Pogoed. Chad left the band in late 1997 and was replaced by Paul Russo from the Unseen, who filled in for two tours; the group ultimately settled on drummer Kid Lynch (formerly of Warzone and SFA).  Their third full-length, C.B.H., was released in 1998.

After an ill-fated tour in 1999, the band began to dissolve, finally doing so in 2001 upon Renee's departure.  Mike, Tim and Chad formed The S.D.A.B.s (Sex Drugs Alcohol Band), while Renee, Lynch and longtime roadie Dean Digaetano formed Dean Dean and the Sex Machines who released an LP. Renee also joined the long-standing founding street punk group U.S. Chaos, replacing her deceased brother in the band. Tim went on to play bass, and then later became the guitarist, for the New York hardcore punk band Murphy's Law, as well as continuing with the Broken Heroes.

===Reformation (2004–present)===
In 2004, Blanks 77 reunited around the "classic lineup" of Mike, Renee, Tim, and Chad.  Although they ceased extensive touring, they remained active on the East Coast while playing occasional West Coast concerts. In 2015 Blanks 77 joined the Jailhouse Records label which released, Gettin' Blasted, a ten-song split 12" release with fellow New Jersey band the Parasitix on April 29, 2016.
