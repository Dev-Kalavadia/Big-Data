==History==
Miyadai entered Tokyo University in 1978 to become a film director. He majored in sociology which he thought might be useful. Meeting Wataru Hiromatsu and Naoki Komuro made Miyadai study seriously. Reading Noam Chomsky also inspired him.

On November 29, 2022, Miyadai was attacked at the Minami-Osawa campus in Hachioji in a widely-reported knife attack. A suspect in the attack committed suicide on December 16, 2022 without explaining his motives.https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/02/b654ee6ae519-suspect-in-attack-on-japanese-sociologist-miyadai-has-died-source.html
