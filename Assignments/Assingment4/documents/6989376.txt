Title: Cruciform eminence
The cruciform eminence (or cruciate eminence) divides the deeply concave internal surface of the occipital bone into four fossae:
* The upper two fossae are called the cerebral fossae, are triangular and lodge the occipital lobes of the cerebrum.
* The lower two are called the cerebellar fossae, are quadrilateral and accommodate the hemispheres of the cerebellum.

The upper fossae are separated from the lower fossae by a groove for the transverse sinuses. At the point of intersection between all four fossae is the internal occipital protuberance.
