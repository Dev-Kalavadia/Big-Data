Title: Tecuamburro

Tecuamburro is a stratovolcano in southern Guatemala, roughly 50 kilometres south east of Guatemala City. The Tecuamburro is an andesitic stratovolcano which formed approximately 38,000 years ago inside a horseshoe-shaped caldera formed by a structural failure in a second, 100,000-year-old stratovolcano, known as Miraflores. At the top of the Tecuamburro is an acidic crater lake around which many hot springs, fumaroles, and boiling mudpots are found.
