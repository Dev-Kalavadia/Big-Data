==Syrian Response==
In 2000, Syria released 54 Lebanese political prisoners, which according to the Syrian side were all its prisoners. Syria has also affirmed the existence of 88 Lebanese citizens under criminal sentences and hence, according to the Syrian side, are not political prisoners but are having their regular criminal sentences.

==Rafic Hariri's Response==
Before the 54 Lebanese prisoners were released from the Syrian side, lists that include around 260 Lebanese prisoners were being spread, which were according to him during a speech on 2000/12/12 inaccurate and would "make us remember all the civil war's terrible mess again", and that Syria has released the Lebanese citizens it had, supporting Syria's claim that it had released all its political prisoners.
