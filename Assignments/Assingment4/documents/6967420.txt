Title: Heinz mean

In mathematics, the Heinz mean (named after E. HeinzE. Heinz (1951), "Beiträge zur Störungstheorie der Spektralzerlegung",  Math. Ann., 123, pp. 415–438.) of two non-negative real numbers A and B, was defined by Bhatia. as:

:\operatorname{H}_x(A, B) = \frac{A^x B^{1-x} + A^{1-x} B^x}{2},

with 0 ≤ x ≤ .

For different values of x, this Heinz mean interpolates between the arithmetic (x = 0) and geometric (x = 1/2) means such that for 0 < x < :

:\sqrt{A B} = \operatorname{H}_\frac{1}{2}(A, B) < \operatorname{H}_x(A, B) < \operatorname{H}_0(A, B) = \frac{A + B}{2}.

The Heinz means appear naturally when symmetrizing 
\alpha-divergences.
.

It may also be defined in the same way for positive semidefinite matrices, and satisfies a similar interpolation formula...
