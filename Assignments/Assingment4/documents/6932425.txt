==History==
Gordevio is first mentioned in 1200 as de gordauio.  In 1335 it was mentioned as de Gordavio.

The parish church of SS Giacomo e Filippo, is first mentioned in the 13th century.  The current building was built in the 17th century on the remains of a previous church from the 14th century.  It contains paintings by Giovanni Antonio Vanoni (19th century) and probably by Giuseppe Antonio Felice Orelli, who created frescoes in the adjacent ossuary in 1753.  In village of Brièè, in 1666, the chapel of S. Antonio Abate was built.  In the 14th century both Gordevio and Avegno had their own chaplain.  The two villages broke away from the mother church in Maggia, and parted from each other probably about 1645.

The village center of contains some houses from the 19th century.  Due to lack of farming land, emigration (at first mainly to Rome, but in the second half of the 19th century overseas as well) lowered the number of inhabitants.  In the last decades of the 20th century, the population has risen again.  This increase is mainly due to its proximity to agglomeration of Locarno.  Agricultural jobs have practically disappeared from the village.
