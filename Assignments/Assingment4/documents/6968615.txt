La Furia Naranja (Orange Fury) is the nickname of Villa Clara province baseball team, the name was also given since 2009 to everything painted in orange throughout the city.

==History and architecture==
The architects Emilio Castro and Gustavo R. Arnavat projected the Sandino in 1963 using the technique of articulated precast molding. In an effort to take the National Sport to every corner of the country, they were looking for a design solution that was less expensive and easier to adapt to the rest of Cuban cities without baseball facilities. It has an area of  and capacity for 10,000 people. It opened on January 8, 1966.

The substructure is made out of concrete cast in-situ. Prefabricated structures such as vaults and PEPSA joints that hold the ceiling tiles were made using prefabricated reinforced concrete. The lobby's floor is tiled with Cuban marble, while the rest of the structure has polished concrete floor.

The gallery of the stadium has 148 columns from  high sustaining 100 beams. It has ten lighting towers  high with 320 bulbs of 1500 Watts. The stadium's water supply is provided by gravity from an elevated tank of 10,000 gallon capacity. It also has among its facilities a dorm room with 208 beds, nursery, bathrooms, lockers, warehouses and offices.

This structure's design was first built in Santa Clara city and subsequently repeated in the cities of Camagüey, Matanzas and Pinar del Rio. Then slowly to the rest of the country's cities and towns. The Cienfuego's stadium executed on September 5, 1977 is a good example of how the Sandino architectural typology could be re-adapted and slightly modified to create a similar looking building with some variants.View of the stadium on Flickr
