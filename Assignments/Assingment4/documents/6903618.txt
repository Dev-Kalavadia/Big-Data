The Perry Theatre was christened the "Little Broadway" of Stark County by the Canton Repository. The term was highlighted as part of a feature article reporting the yearly successes, sell-out crowds and continued demand for tickets that the Perry Theatre had established over the years. Theatre Students, along with their directors as well as school administrators accepted the title. With that acceptance the Perry Theatre established a yearly mission and commitment to uphold the honor. The Perry Players perform at the Louie Mattachione Theatre at Perry High School, and were under the direction of Louie Mattachione for over 50 years until his retirement.
