Title: SuperPin
SuperPin is the name given to any of the widebody pinball games released by Williams and Midway (under the Bally name) between 1993 and late-1994.

Aside from the widebody playfield (being almost as wide as the backbox of the machine), these games often include extra gimmicks and toys which would add to the gameplay (e.g., the gumball machine in Twilight Zone, the dual Phasers in Star Trek: The Next Generation or the dual gamemode playfield of Judge Dredd). All of the SuperPins use the DCS Sound System, except for Twilight Zone.
