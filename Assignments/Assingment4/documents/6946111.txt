Title: Jim McGovern (golfer)

James David McGovern (born February 5, 1965) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour.

== Early life ==
McGovern was born in Teaneck, New Jersey.Dorman, Larry. "Golf; McGovern Gets Comfort Of Home and a Lead", The New York Times, March 10, 1995. Accessed February 16, 2011. "So it was fitting today that Jim McGovern, born in Teaneck and raised in Oradell, where he lives now, strolled around the grounds here with one of the biggest galleries and shot the lowest number in the first round of the Honda Classic." He grew up in Oradell, New Jersey in a house adjoining the Hackensack Golf Club.Friend, Tom. "Golf; You Can't Take the Hackensack Out of This Guy", The New York Times, February 28, 1993. Accessed February 16, 2011. "He grew up in Oradell, N.J., in a house literally adjacent to the fourth green at Hackensack Golf Club. I remember once finding a stray ball in the upstairs bathroom, he said." McGovern attended Bergen Catholic High School and was a star football player there. However, a coach introduced him to golf during his junior year.Brown, Clifton. "Golf; A Former Rising Star Hopes to Rise Again", The New York Times, December 18, 1999. Accessed February 16, 2011. "When Jim McGovern was an all-state tight end at Bergen Catholic High School, few people would have predicted that he would become a professional golfer. He didn't start playing golf seriously until 11th grade." 

== Amateur career ==
McGovern initially attended the University of Arkansas as a non-scholarship member of its golf team. He transferred after two years to Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia and was a member of that school's golf team. He turned pro in 1988 and joined the PGA Tour in 1991.

== Professional career ==
McGovern was a member of the PGA Tour from 1991–1998. His career year was 1993 when he won once, had two other top-10 finishes, earned $587,495 and finished 27th on the money list. His best finish in a major was T5 at the 1994 Masters Tournament. He had 14 career top-10 finishes in 386 PGA Tour events.

McGovern finished 19th in qualifying school and earned his PGA Tour card for 2008; he made the cut in 11 of 26 events. In 2009, he was back on the Nationwide Tour.

On January 1, 2011, McGovern became the head golf professional at White Beeches Golf & Country Club in Haworth, New Jersey, 20 miles from midtown Manhattan. He is one of the few PGA Professionals who was also a PGA Tour winner.

On May 17, 2011, McGovern earned medalist honors at the local U.S. Open qualifier. His 4-under 68 at Ballyowen Golf Club gave him medalist honors by two strokes and also secured for him one of five spots available for the U.S. Open sectional qualifier at Canoe Brook on June 6. McGovern earned a spot in the 2014 PGA Championship through his finish at the PGA Professional National Championship after having to qualify in a playoff for one of the twenty positions. He occasionally continues to compete at senior major events and those sanctioned through the New Jersey section of the PGA of America.
