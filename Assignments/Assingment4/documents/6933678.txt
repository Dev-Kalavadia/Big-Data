Title: Gnosca

Gnosca is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

On 2 April 2017 the former municipalities of Camorino, Claro, Giubiasco, Gorduno, Gudo, Moleno, Monte Carasso, Pianezzo, Preonzo, Sant'Antonio and Sementina merged into the municipality of Bellinzona.

==History==
Gnosca is first mentioned in 1198 as Niosca in the records of Como and the cathedral of Milan.  While it is likely that there were earlier settlements, nothing is known about them.  An arbitration document of 1202 granted the S. Giovanni church and the church of SS Maurizio e Carpoforo in Gnosca Castle to Como.  The parish church of St. Peter Martyr is on a list of churches in the diocese of Milan in the 13th century.  In 1335 Gnosca is mentioned as a village in the county of Bellinzona, although part of the population was assumed for some time by the cathedral of Milan.  This led to a situation where the church was used for both the Ambrosian and Roman Rites at the same time.  The village is now on the edge of the agglomeration of Bellinzona.  With the construction of many new homes it has lost, in recent decades, its rural character.
