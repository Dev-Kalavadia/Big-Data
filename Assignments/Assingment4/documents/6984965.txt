Title: Heartworm (album)



Heartworm is an album by the Irish rock band Whipping Boy, released on 1 November 1995 on Columbia Records. It was recorded between September and November 1994 in Windmill Lane Studios, Dublin.

Heartworm was voted the seventh best Irish album of all time in a 2005 poll by the Irish magazine Hot Press. On 17 March 2013, it topped Phantom FM's poll of the top 50 Irish albums of all time.

==Release==
The album was reissued on 3 September 2021 by Pete Paphides' Needle Mythology label on double LP and double CD, both formats containing an extra 10 B-sides and demos. Pre-orders announced in July included an art print signed by Page, McDonnell and Hassett. The double LP sold out almost immediately during the pre-order, prompting a second pressing. The first pressing made Heartworm chart for the first time in the Official Irish Albums Chart Top 50 (at number 8 on week ending 16 September 2021), with the album re-entering at number 4 in January 2022.
