Title: Colin McEvedy



Colin Peter McEvedy (6 June 1930 â€“ 1 August 2005) was a British polymath scholar, psychiatrist, historian, demographer and non-fiction author.

==Early life==
Colin Peter McEvedy was born in Salford, Lancashire on 6 June 1930.  He was the third son of Peter George McEvedy, a renowned surgeon, who was born in New Zealand. Colin was educated at Harrow School, where he was a scholar, and Magdalen College, Oxford.

==Career==
McEvedy's profession was psychiatry, in which he had a distinguished career.  He became perhaps better known, though, as a historian and demographer, and certainly so by the public at large.   Between 1961 and 2002 he produced a number of historical atlases which, unlike most such atlases, feature fixed base-maps; in most cases, each atlas uses a single principal base-map, which is shown repeatedly, at many dates, as the atlas goes along, thus illustrating changes over the ages, from ancient down to modern, within the chosen area.  The accompanying text, typically, is mostly a running commentary on what the maps of a given atlas show.  Another feature of the atlases is McEvedy's witty and engaging writing-style, which he used on occasion to challenge established opinions among historians and demographers.  Although he was not, strictly speaking, a professional in those fields, he became professionally respected in them, with his views making their way into standard textbooks.

He died in London, following a diagnosis of terminal myelofibrosis.

==Family life==
