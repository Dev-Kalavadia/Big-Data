The Sassafras was named after a type of tree, most famous for flavoring root beer.  All of the 180s were named after trees, shrubs, or flowers. This was a continuation of the longstanding Lighthouse Service practice of naming tenders after foliage found in the tenderâ€™s intended area of operations. For the 180s, however, there was no particular area of operations envisioned for individual vessels.
