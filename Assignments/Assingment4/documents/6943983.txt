Title: Cheater Slicks


Cheater Slicks is a three-man garage punk band formed in Boston in 1987. The members are Tom Shannon (guitar, vocals), Dave Shannon (guitar), and Dana Hatch (drums, vocals). They toured with Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in 1995.

In their early days they experimented with a couple of different singers and periods as an instrumental band before Tom and Dana assumed vocal duties. They also went through a succession of bassists - Dina Pearlman (daughter of Alan R. Pearlman), Allan Paulinho ("Alpo" from the Real Kids), and finally Merle Allin (brother of G.G. Allin) - before deciding to go bassless like the Cramps.

The band relocated to Columbus, OH, in 1996 and is still active. They played their 20th anniversary show on Sept. 1, 2007. They have released several albums on In the Red Records.

The band received special notice when Mudhoney covered their song "Ghost" on their fifth studio album "Tomorrow Hit Today".

Almost Ready Records has re-released three of Cheater Slicks' albums on vinyl. "On Your Knees" in 2016, and "Destination Lonely" in 2017. In 2011 Almost Ready Records released "Our Food Is Chaos: Allen Paulino Session" for the first time on vinyl. They also appear on 2012's "The World's Lousy With Ideas Vol 9", another Almost Ready Records release.
