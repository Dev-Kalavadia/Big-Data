Muzzano is first mentioned in 1189 as Muciano.  Agnuzzo was the center of a large manor farm, which was given in 819 by Emperor Louis the Pious to the clergy of Como.  In the course of the 11th century, the property passed to the Abbey of S. Abbondio in Como.  In 1579, the property and rights of the Abbey were leased to the municipality and to private individuals.

It belonged to the Pieve of Agno until it became an independent parish in 1735.  The parish church of S. Maria dell'Annunciazione probably dates to the 16th century.  The Chapel of  S. Andrea in Agnuzzo is mentioned for the first time in 1208.

The village was home to many construction workers, especially plasterers, who emigrated to other countries for work.  The local economy was based on silk farming, viticulture and agriculture.  In the flat land on the left bank of the Vedeggio river, the Mulini Tues Biogno industrial zone developed in the last decades of the 20th century.  The hilly area above the valley is dominated by residential buildings.  The small lake of Muzzano is a protected habitat, and has, since 1945, been part of Pro Natura.  Two important pedagogical research schools were built in Muzzano.  The first was the school of Alberto Lamoni in 1827 and the Scuola Serena of Maria Boschetti-Alberti in 1917–24.  In 2000, about three-quarters of the workforce were commuters.
