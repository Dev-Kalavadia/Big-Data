Title: Soul Deep (Roxette song)

"Soul Deep" is a song by Swedish pop music duo Roxette, released on 17 February 1987 by EMI as the third single from their debut album, Pearls of Passion (1986). The song was originally written in Swedish by Per Gessle, and was called "Dansar nerför ditt stup i rekordfart" ("Dancing Down Your Dive in Record Speed"), although Gessle later wrote new English lyrics for the song after deciding its Swedish lyrics were "too silly". The single was only released in Sweden, Germany and Canada. It spent three consecutive weeks at number 18 on the Swedish Singles Chart, but failed to chart in the other two countries.

The song was backed by the previously unreleased title track from their debut album, which would later see a wider release as the b-side to their 1992 single "Queen of Rain", and also as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of Pearls of Passion. 12" editions of the single contain an extended mix of the a-side. This remix was created by Kaj Erixon and can also be found on the remix compilation Dance Passion, released in March 1987. A re-arranged and remixed version of "Soul Deep" later appeared on the duo's 1991 album Joyride.
