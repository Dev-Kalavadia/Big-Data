Title: Queen of Rain

"Queen of Rain" is a pop ballad by Swedish duo Roxette. It was released on 28 October 1992 as the second single from their fourth studio album, Tourism (1992). The song became a top twenty hit in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, and spent over three months on the German Singles Chart, where it peaked at number nineteen.

==Background and recording==
The song was recorded in July 1990 at EMI Studios in Stockholm during sessions for their 1991 album Joyride. It was originally set to appear as that album's final track, but was excluded in favour of "Perfect Day". However, the closing notes and sound effects contained on the outro of the album version of "Things Will Never Be the Same" – the track which precedes "Perfect Day" on Joyride – can still be heard over the crowd noise contained on the intro of "Queen of Rain". Roxette later recorded a Spanish version of the track, titled "Una reina va detrás de un rey" ("A Queen Goes After a King"), for their 1996 compilation album Baladas en Español.

Prior to the release of "Queen of Rain", one of the single's b-side, "Pearls of Passion", had remained unreleased outside of Sweden. The song would later be included as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of their debut album, Pearls of Passion (1986).

==Critical reception==
AllMusic editor Bryan Buss described the song as "haunting" and "hopeful" in his review of Tourism.
