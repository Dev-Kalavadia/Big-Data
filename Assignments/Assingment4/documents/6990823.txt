Title: Siege of Kannomine


The 1554 siege of Kannomine was one of many battles fought in Takeda Shingen's campaign to seize control of Shinano Province. This took place during Japan's Sengoku period; Shingen was one of many feudal lords (daimy≈çs) who battled to gain land and power.

Kannomine was located in the Ina valley in Japan's Shinano province; it was commanded by Yoritomo Chiku, and was taken just prior to the sieges of Matsuo and Yoshioka.
