In 2012, because of his oversight portfolio over Guyana's security sector, Clement Rohee was accused of being responsible for the deaths of three unarmed protesters in the Guyanese mining town of Linden during a protest against economic conditions in that town. He subsequently denied any responsibility for the killings at a special inquiry held in Guyana after the incident.

In July 2012, Guyana's opposition-dominated parliament passed a no confidence motion against Rohee, which urged him to resign over parliament's lack of confidence in him running the security sector. The PPP government refused to adhere to the opposition motion. The speaker of parliament later ruled that the opposition motion had no legal merit, and as such lifted the gagging motion against Rohee.

The PPP Central Committee elected Rohee as General Secretary of the PPP on 19 August 2013. Rohee succeeded President Donald Ramotar, who nominated Rohee for the post."Clement Rohee elected as new General Secretary of PPP", INEWS Guyana, 19 August 2013.
