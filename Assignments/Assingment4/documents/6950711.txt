Caviano is first mentioned in 1258 as Caviliano.

In 1264 and again in 1365, the Bishop of Como transferred part of the tithes of the Gambarogno valley, including Caviano and Scaiano, to the Magoria and Duno families from Locarno.  Caviano originally belonged to the parish of Locarno, then in 1558 to Sant'Abbondio.  It became a separate parish in 1850.  The old church, the foundation is pre-Roman, was demolished in 1864 after the completion of the new church of S. Maria Nascente.  Due to limited fishing and farming land, much of the population emigrated to other cantons or countries.  The old outskirts of the village is still easily visible.

This type of shelter/barn was commonly used on the pastures (monti) around Lake Maggiore.
