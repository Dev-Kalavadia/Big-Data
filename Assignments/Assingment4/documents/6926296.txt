===1943 establishment===
The community was formed in 1943 in Rishon LeZion by help of UK government and young Jewish refugees (olim) from Austria, Italy and Germany, all of whom were members of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed who had been educated at kibbutz Givat Brenner.

The kibbutz itself was established on 7 July 1943 as one of the three lookouts, and was initially named Tel HaTzofim (lit. Scout's hill). It was later renamed Revivim by Berl Katznelson after the magazine edited by Yosef Haim Brenner (for whom Givat Brenner was named), and its name is also taken from the Bible, : "You (Lord) ... level its ridges, you soften it with showers."Carta's Official Guide to Israel and Complete Gazetteer to all Sites in the Holy Land.
