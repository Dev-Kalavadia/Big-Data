==History==
Founded in 1959, Dallas Theater Center was one of the first regional theaters in the United States with Paul Baker at the helm and it also served as Baylor's graduate drama program. The Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Kalita Humphreys Theater was its first home.   By 1983 under the leadership of Adrian Hall, DTC became a professional theater company and made their annual presentation of A Christmas Carol an official tradition. During Hall's tenure, the company launched Project Discovery, its educational arm, and began to program in the downtown Arts District Theater.  

During Baker's tenure, Dallas Theater Center became one of the nation's leading producers of experimental interpretations of classics and world premieres, with 35 plays premiering on the Kalita Humphreys Theater stage during his time, including The Latent Heterosexual, Shadow of an Eagle, Blood Money, and Preston Jones' A Texas Trilogy. Other notable productions include DTC's 'Give it Up! which transferred to Broadway as Lysistrata Jones, The Good Negro which ran at New York City's Public Theater in 2009 and Bella" An American Tall Tale which transferred to Playwrights Horizons.

In 2017, DTC was awarded the Regional Theatre Tony Award.
