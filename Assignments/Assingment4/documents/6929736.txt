When she tries to drink poison he stops her and ask her why she is committing suicide. She says that she was a medical student and her chief asked her to conduct a post-mortem on a woman. She was coerced into reporting that it was a case of suicide, but she conclusively proved that the woman was killed and that it was done by her husband Thillainathan. For this, Thillainathan spoiled Thilaka's name, killed her mother and tried to kill her also. She did not want to die at their hands, so she decided to commit suicide.

== Reception ==
Malini Mannath of The Indian Express wrote, "With a weak storyline, an abundance of characters who are never really justified, and a half-hearted treatment, Magudam is a film which never really takes off from the scene one." Sujitha Sridharan of Kalki felt the film had very artificial scenes, fragmented scenes and ordinary music from Raja.
