Title: Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal

The Gold Medal is the highest award of the Australian Institute of Architects, awarded annually since 1960. The award was created to recognise distinguished service by Australian architects who have: 
* designed or executed buildings of high merit; 
* produced work of great distinction resulting in the advancement of architecture; or 
* endowed the profession of architecture in a distinguished manner.

Until August 2008, the Institute traded as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the award was called the RAIA Gold Medal.
