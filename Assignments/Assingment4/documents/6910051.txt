Title: Manchurian wapiti


The Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is a subspecies of the wapiti native to East Asia.

==Description==

The Manchurian wapiti's coat is reddish brown during summer, and brownish gray in winter. It has dark hairs on the neck and dark underparts, followed by a light-colored rump patch. It is smaller than North American elk (Cervus canadensis canadensis) with smaller and stouter antlers.

Male deer are wapiti-like with a neck mane, and as mentioned, relatively small wapiti-like antlers.  Female deer are more red deer-like and lack neck manes.  This deer is the most red deer-like of the wapiti, being adapted to mixed deciduous forest environments in Manchuria, Yakutia, Northern China, Eastern Mongolia, and Korea.  Like many red deer, adult deer may have some visible spots in their summer coats.

==Range==

This deer is found in southeastern Siberia (to the east of Lake Baikal), northeastern Mongolia, Manchuria, North KoreaIncheon National University, 2019, 한반도 포유류(척삭동물문: 포유강)의 분류학적 정립과 한국 지형에 맞는 포유류 조사기법 연구 (Studies on the Taxonomic Review and Survey Techniques for Mammals in the Korean Peninsula), p.108 (PDF) and northeastern China.  
Similar forms from Alxa, Gansu, Shanxi and southern Mongolia were originally described as a distinct subspecies, the Alashan wapiti (Cervus canadensis alashanicus). However recent genetic research indicates that this deer belongs to the Manchurian subspecies.Mitochondrial DNA phylogeography of red deer (Cervus elaphus), by Christian J. Ludt.
