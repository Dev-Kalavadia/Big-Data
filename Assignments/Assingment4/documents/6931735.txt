Title: General education liceumA general education liceum (Polish: Liceum ogólnokształcące ) is an academic high school in the Polish educational system. They are attended by those who plan to further their academic education upon graduation from szkoła podstawowa (compulsory education) through a path other than Technikum or Vocational school (since it's impossible for one to be at the age of 18 or more upon graduation from szkola podstawowa, thus education is still mandatory for them one has to pick one of the three).



Before graduating from liceum, students take a final exam called a "matura" (equivalent to the A-Level). It's a tradition for students of graduating grades and school staff to host and attend a prom called "studniówka" about a 100 days before the exams.Regarding the matura & studniówka (Polish)

There are several types (ages of students in brackets):
* General Liceum (15-19)
* Specialized Liceum (15-19)
* Supplementary Liceum (17-20, optional for vocational school graduates wanting to supplement their education)
