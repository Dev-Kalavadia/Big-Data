Title: Sri Bhashyathumb|Painting of Ramanuja, Hutchinson's History of the Nations

The Sri Bhashya () is the most famous work of the Hindu philosopher Ramanuja (1017–1137). It is his commentary on Badarayana's Vedanta/Brahma Sutra. 

== Description ==
In his commentary, Ramanuja presents the fundamental philosophical principles of Vishishtadvaita based on his interpretation of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita and other Smriti texts, the previous acharyas, and the Vedanta-sutra itself. This is done by way of refuting Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and in particular his theory of maya. In this work, he describes the three categories of reality (tattvas): God, soul, and matter, which have been used by the later Vaishnava theologians such as Madhva. He explains the relationship between the body and the soul. The principles of bhakti as a means to liberation (moksha) were also developed. Ramanuja wrote the Vedanta-Dipa and Vedanta-Sara to aid in the overall understanding of the Sri Bhashya.
