Title: Annabella, County Cork


Annabella is a townland near Mallow, County Cork in Ireland. Some sources give the townland's Irish name as Eanach-bile, and translate it as "marsh of the sacred tree [bile]". Other sources dispute this derivation as a back-formed neologism.Regarding the eanach-bile (marsh of the sacred tree) derivation advanced by P.W. Joyce or indeed the áth an bhile (ford of the sacred tree) proffered by Eugene O Curry in the Ordnance Survey Namebook (1840), both are incorrect. O Curry's colleague, Dr. John O Donovan, was correct in his assertion 'I think that this is a fancy name' (Ordnance Survey Namebook). It may have derived from a one-time female resident of Annabella House, now demolished. Details of the house and demesne are given in Houses Of Cork, Vol.1-North, p.29 (Anna-Maria Hajba) where she cites Joyce's derivation of eanach bile. Early name-forms include: Annabelle(1719), Annabel(1721), Anabel(1750), Annable(1776) and thereafter Annabelle (1811, 1830, 1837 and 1840).
