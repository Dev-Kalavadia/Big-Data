==Naming==
The Eldama Ravine (E/Ravine) was first known as Shimoni due to the presence of a narrow ravine through which the Eldama Ravine River flows. Eldama, the non-English part of the name, is derived from the Maasai word ‘eldama’, which means narrow gorge. It had two areas known as lembus soi( Mogotio constituency) and lembus mosop(eldama ravine constituency)

The town was established by Nubians who worked as soldiers and transporters for the British IBEA in 1887, white settlers and the native lembus community. It became the headquarters of the Naivasha province, then under the Uganda Protectorate.MORRIS KIRUGA. Daily Nation. How local dialects influenced naming of west Kenya towns. 23 July 2013
