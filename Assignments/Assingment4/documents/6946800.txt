Title: Shobdon Aerodrome



Shobdon Aerodrome  is an airport  west of Leominster, Herefordshire, England.

==RAF Shobdon==
Shobdon started as a British Army camp. It acted as a reception point for casualties received from Southampton being distributed to local hospitals. With a depot railway station developed on the Leominster and Kington Railway, its first casualties arrived after the Battle of Dunkirk.

The camp was developed further by the United States Army from 1943, to act as a distribution point for two locally developed general hospitals. They also added a runway in co-operation with the Royal Air Force, but due to the marshy land only one runway was developed.

In 1943, RAF No. 1 Glider Training School moved from RAF Thame to Shobdon, enabling an increase in training of glider pilots in preparation for Normandy and Arnhem landings.

The RAF Gliding School closed in 1953, when the site was handed to Herefordshire County Council.
