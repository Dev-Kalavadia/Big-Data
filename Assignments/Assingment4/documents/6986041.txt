==Critical reception==

The Washington Post wrote that "the album's melodies overshadow the lyrics, conveying an impression that's blithe and hopeful." The Hamilton Spectator noted that "there are flashes of alternative favorites Inspiral Carpets and glimpses of Happy Mondays, but The Bats hold their own in terms of strong songwriting, even though their lyrics seem internal and uncertain."
