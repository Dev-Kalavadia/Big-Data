In 1639 the department was renamed and expanded to "Lifan Yuan" in Chinese and "Tulergi golo be dasara jurgan" in Manchu. The Manchu name literally means the department for the administration of outlying regions.The Imperial Moment, by Kimberly Kagan, p97 During the period of the Late Qing Reform or New Policies, the name was changed again to Lifan Ministry () in 1907 and existed until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912.

==Function==

Prior to the establishment of the Zongli Yamen, the Court also supervised the empire's relation with Russia under the treaties of Nerchinsk and Kyakhta. Lifan Yuan was exclusively staffed with members from the Eight Banners. Lifan Yuan was the closest administrative office that the Qing dynasty had that would have been comparable with a foreign policy department.

Guests of the Lifan Yuan were housed in the Bureau of Interpreters () in the southeast part of the Inner City, later also known as the Russian hostel () due to the predominance of Russian visitors there. It was also called the ‘south pavilion’ (南館 nan kuan) to distinguish it from the ‘north pavilion’ (北館 pei kuan) where the Albazinians lived. From the Treaty of Kyakhta this residence became permanent.

There was also a Russian Language Institute (), which was a school where Manchus learned to speak Russian. Founded in 1708, it was incorporated into the newly founded Tongwen Guan in 1862.

The Lifan Yuan was roughly a Qing version of the Xuanzheng Yuan () or Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, instituted by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty for administering affairs in Tibet.State and Ethnicity in China's Southwest, by Xiaolin Guo, p29 It is to be distinguished from the Ministry of Rites, which was the traditional Chinese institution for dealing with all outsiders during the Ming dynasty. The Qing used the Board of Rites to deal with the tributary countries to the south and east like Joseon Korea, Nguyen dynasty Vietnam, the Ryukyu Kingdom and western peoples who came by sea like the Dutch and the English. The Lifan Yuan was established at the time of Huang Taiji to deal with the Mongols. After the establishment to the Qing dynasty it continued to be a separate institution for dealing with Mongols and Russians and other Inner Asian peoples to the north and west. It was replaced by the Zongli Yamen for conducting foreign relations in 1861.
