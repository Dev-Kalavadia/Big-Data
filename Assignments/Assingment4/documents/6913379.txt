Title: Fish Creek railway station



Fish Creek was a railway station on the South Gippsland line in South Gippsland, Victoria. The station was opened during the 1890s and operated until 1992 when the line to Barry Beach servicing the oil fields in Bass Strait was closed. The line was then dismantled and turned into the Great Southern Rail Trail. Fish Creek contained a rather extensive goods yard, all of which now has been demolished. The remaining platform is still in good condition.
