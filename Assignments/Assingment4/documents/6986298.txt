Nikki Clan is a Mexican Pop rock band from Nogales, Sonora and Mexicali, Baja California. It is formed by Yadira Gianola (lead vocals), Alberto Espinosa (bass guitar), José Antonio Dabdoub (guitar), Ángel Yáñez (guitar), and José Carlos Fausto Monroy (drums). It was created in 2005 by known producer Abelardo Vázquez (also producer of Reik), and released its first album in 2006. The self-titled album, Nikki Clan, is part of a five-album contract with Sony BMG. "Mirame" (Look at me) was released as the first single with tremendous success.
Its name is in honor of Nikki Sixx, an idol for Gianola.

Nikki Clan disbanded in 2010, following Gianola's first pregnancy, but they reunited in 2022 as part of the 2000's Pop Tour.
