Title: Jabalcón

Jabalcón or Cerro Jabalcón is a mountain near the city of Baza in the Granada province in Spain. It reaches a height of 1,494 metres above sea level.

At the foot of Javalon are the Baños de Zújar (baths of Zújar). They maintain a temperature over 30°C all year round, and are heated by a geo-thermal source underground.

The mountain also has a church situated on top as well as television and other communication towers. Paragliders frequently launch from the top of here as the mountain is surrounded by relatively flat land.

==Geology==
Popular legend claims that this hill is an extinct volcano because of its dome-shape and the geo-thermal sources at its base. It is however an isolated limestone outcrop, made up of dolomite, similar to the composition of the Sierra de Baza mountains further away.Depresión de Guadix-Baza
