Title: Kalamunda Road




Kalamunda Road is a minor arterial road linking the historic suburb of South Guildford with the Darling Scarp suburb of Kalamunda, in Perth, Western Australia.

It serves as a major access road for Perth Airport, and provides the foothills suburbs with access to the Perth central business district.

==Route==
Beginning at the historical and now bypassed Great Eastern Highway in South Guildford, the road passes through a light industrial area, and meets the Great Eastern Highway Bypass, which provides access to Perth City and Midland.

It then passes by Perth Airport and Guildford Cemetery, before passing through the foothills suburbs of High Wycombe and Maida Vale. After meeting Roe Highway, it is allocated State Route 41, and is dual carriageway for this section between the highway and Hawtin Road. It then reverts to single carriageway and ascends the Darling Scarp. This section is colloquially known as Kalamunda Hill. It ends in the Kalamunda town centre.
