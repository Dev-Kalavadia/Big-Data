In 1859, Morgan C. Hamilton bought large tracts of land along Brushy Creek from Shiloh to Rice's Crossing.  Hamilton died in 1883, willing the land to his nephew, Theodore Van Buren Coupland.  Mr. Coupland sold a 100-foot right-of-way to the Taylor, Bastrop and Austin Railroad in 1887.  Two Taylor men subsequently formed the Coupland City Corporation to subdivide and sell land for the newly formed  unincorporated community of Coupland.Source:   A Brief History of Coupland
