Title: Mr. Jordan

Mr. Jordan is the third studio album by singer-songwriter Julian Lennon. It was Lennon's first album in three years, after taking a hiatus from the music industry.

== Release ==


It was released in March 1989 on Virgin Records. The album title is a reference to the film Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941).

The album did poorly in the album charts, but the lead single, the David Bowie sounding  "Now You're in Heaven", reached number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.

Cash Box said that "Lennon explores his lower vocal range" in the single "You're the One."

The album was reissued, along with The Secret Value of Daydreaming and Help Yourself, on 8 September 2009 by Noble Rot Records.
