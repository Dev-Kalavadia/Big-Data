Title: It Started with a Kiss (film)



It Started with a Kiss is a 1959 Metrocolor film in CinemaScope starring Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds. It was directed by George Marshall.

==Plot==
After a whirlwind courtship, an Air Force staff sergeant who is a Korean War veteran, Joe Fitzpatrick, and his wife Maggie, a dancer, try to make their marriage work. Joe is posted to Spain; back in New York, his wife learns that he has won a raffle making them the owners of the custom-built 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car. The car is delivered to Spain, where it attracts attention from many people including a famous matador, who makes advances to Maggie and invites her to his estate. The car also comes to the attention of Joe's commanding officer, who insists he ship it back to the States to avoid promoting the image of Americans as snobbishly wealthy. This upsets Maggie. Joe is also told he will owe considerable income tax on the car, which he cannot afford. In the end, Joe sells the car to the matador, and he and Maggie are reconciled.
