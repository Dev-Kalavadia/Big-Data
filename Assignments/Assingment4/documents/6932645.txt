Madhavan in the lead), Nothing But Life (English, shot in Las Vegas) and the eminent actor Bharath Gopi in the film Yamanam (which won a National Award in 1991). He turned actor in Kashmeeram. It was a negative role and more of such roles came his way after that. He won the Critic's Award for Best Debutante Actor for his role in the film Kashmeeram and the Second Best Actor for his role of Hari in the series on MT Kathakal, called Kazhcha, telecast on Amritha TV.

His first directorial venture was for television (Akaasaththile Paravakal, telecast on Kairali Channel). Thalappavu was his big screen directorial debut; the film received the Kerala State Best Debutante Director Award and various other awards. Madhupal has ventured more and more into the world of letters and has published seven collections of short stories. He became engaged in several projects to help those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake; he is associated with Santhigiri Ashram, Thiruvananthapuram as Assistant General Convener Advisory Committee.
