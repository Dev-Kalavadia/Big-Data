The song was written by French-Canadian lyricist Luc Plamondon and Italian composer Romano Musumarra, and produced by Musumarra. "Je danse dans ma tête" reached number three on the chart in Quebec and the music video, directed by Alain DesRochers, won the Much Music Video Award for Best Adult Contemporary Video in 1992. The song was included on Dion's greatest hits album, On ne change pas (2005).

==Background and release==
"Je danse dans ma tête" was written by French-Canadian lyricist Luc Plamondon and Italian composer Romano Musumarra, and produced by Musumarra. It is one of four new songs written for the album Dion chante Plamondon, which was released in Canada in November 1991. "Je danse dans ma tête" was selected as the third Canadian single, after "Des mots qui sonnent" and "L'amour existe encore", and released in March 1992. The same month, "Je danse dans ma tête" was issued as the lead single in France, where the album was renamed Des mots qui sonnent and released in April 1992. The commercial single included other songs from the album, "Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)" and "Les uns contre les autres", and the promotional single featured two remixes of "Je danse dans ma tête": Europe Mix and Club Europe Mix.

==Critical response==
According to Music & Media magazine, Dion took an unexpected turn towards dance in "Je danse dans ma tête", but she sounds confident in her new role. They wrote that the chorus with the word "danse" sung in a deliberate stuttering voice is one of the funniest gimmicks of late.

==Chart performance==
"Je danse dans ma tête" entered the Quebec Airplay Chart on 23 March 1992 and peaked at number three. The song stayed on the chart for fourteen weeks. However, it did not make much impact on the charts in France.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by Alain DesRochers in April 1992. It won the Much Music Video Award for Best Adult Contemporary Video in 1992. In 2005, the music video for "Je danse dans ma tête" was included on Dion's DVD, On ne change pas.
