Title: La Peste (album)


La Peste is the second studio album by Alabama 3, released in 2000.

The album peaked at No. 80 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Critical reception==
Record Collector called the album "a dreamy romp through cinematic mini-masterpieces including 'Sad Eyed Lady Of The Low Life', 'Mansion On The Hill' and 'The Thrills Are Gone'." Trouser Press called it "a disappointing disgrace of an album," writing "the new, gussied-up A3 (designed, perhaps, not to offend Sopranos fans) is merely overproduced and out of ideas." NME deemed it "deeply pointless, if hilarious" and an "almost monumental waste of time." The Independent judged it "infectiously intelligent," writing that the band still operates "fruitfully at the convergence of country, funk, gospel and drug culture."
