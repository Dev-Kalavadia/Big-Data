Title: Furesø (lake)

Furesø is a lake in Northeastern Zealand, Denmark and the deepest lake in Denmark. It defined Farum municipality's southeast border and is the site of Nicolai Eigtved's 18th century small pleasure pavilion for Privy Councillor Johan Sigismund Schulin on the Furesø Lake called Frederiksdal Pavilion.

The lake neighbours the adjacent Farum Lake, to which it is connected by a short stream, Fiskebaek. 

It is the namesake of Furesø municipality, which was formed January 1, 2007 as a merger of the two former municipalities Farum and Værløse. It has a popular beach on its western shore, which is within the municipality.
