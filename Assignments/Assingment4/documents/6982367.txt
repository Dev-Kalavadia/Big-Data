Title: Zantop Air Transport


Zantop Air Transport was a United States airline formed from Zantop Flying Service in 1962.  The Civil Aeronautics Board approved transfer of the operating certificate of Coastal Airlines to Zantop Air Transport, which had incorporated and become a supplemental air carrier.  The former company had been a hauler for the Big Three automakers.  With the new arrangement Zantop could provide individually waybilled services.  The original founders of Zantop Flying Services, the Zantop brothers, all sold their stock and resigned from the company in 1966, at which time it became Universal Airlines, Inc.

The airline was based at Wayne County Airport, Inkster, Michigan.

In 1952 the company obtained a commercial operators permit and began to service Chrysler and Ford.  A year later in 1953 they moved the operations to Wayne Major Airport, now Detroit Metro Airport.
