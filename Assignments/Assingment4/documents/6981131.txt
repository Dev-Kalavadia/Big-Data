The Vicinanza of Massagno emerged from the villages of Massagno and Gerso, and during the Middle Ages it was part of the Pieve of Lugano. During the 9th and 10th centuries, the Cathedral of S. Lorenzo in Lugano seems to have owned individual farms and houses in the village, and in 1198 it was the main landholder.   At the same time, the Kastlanei Sonvico owned some estates. In 1262 the hospital of St. Mary of Lugano acquired some estates as well, which were sold in 1739 to the Luvini family in Massagno. In 1329, the provost of the Humiliati monastery of S . Antonio in Lugano bought land in the village. Then, in the 14th century, the Bishop of Como acquired the right to tithe in Massagno and land in Gerso.

Historically, Massagno was part of the Lugano parish. Between 1920 and 1927, together with Rovello, it formed one of Luganos five rettorati. The Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua in Gerso is from 1655 to 1670 and was restored in 1983. It was built by a member of the Solari family from Gerso, who had made his fortune in the wool trade in Venice.

Between 1815 and 1830, the main road into the village was built. Between 1879 and 1880 an excavation for a railway line led to strong population growth as workers (especially from Italy) migrated to Massagno for work. In 2000, about three quarters commuted out of town for work. The school complex was built in 1970–71.

==Traffic==
Massagno is in close proximity to the SBB station Lugano on the Gotthard axis, which leads through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, opened in 2018, and thus on its main axis Zurich – Milan. Rail service of the Ceneri Base Tunnel started on 4 September 2020 and was operationalised for freight in December 2020.  The tunnel improves the connection of Lugano (and therefore also of Massagno) by local trains to the cities of Bellinzona and Locarno significantly. The travel time between Locarno and Lugano is reduced by the new tunnel from 55 to 22 minutes.
