==Origin==
===Derived from name of Irish god===
In Ireland, Hayes originated as a Gaelic polygenetic surname "O hAodha", meaning descendant of Aodh ("fire"), or of Aed, an Irish mythological god. Septs in most counties anglicised "O hAodha" to "Hayes".  In County Cork, it became "O'Hea".  In the province of Ulster, it became "Hughes", the patronymic of Hugh, an anglicized variant of the given name Aodh. Hayes is noted on a public record in County Wexford as early as 1182. In County Cork, under the Munster providence, Hayes falls under the banner of the McNamara clan in the Dalcassian Sept.  Other Irish Hayeses have also been associated with Clan Cian, the ruling O'Carroll clan of southern Ireland.Citation: kthomas, 2002.Citation: Hayes, John; 2008.

===Derived from place-name element===


====England====
In England, Hayes arose as a locational surname, associated with one of the several places named or suffixed -Hay, -Hays, -Hayes, etc., such as those in Kent, or Middlesex. Such place names had two origins, one based on the Old English haes (brushwood, underwood) and the other based on horg (enclosure) or hege (hedge).Citation: Hayes surname meaning The distribution of Hayes in Great Britain in 1881 and 1998 is similar, and restricted to areas of England well separated from Scotland and showing some penetration into Wales.Citation: Longley et al. This surname has gained in popularity in the century between 1881 and 1998, but remains at a rank below 150 and a frequency lower than that in the United States and some other countries of the Commonwealth.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, Hayes is a Scoto-Norman surname, a direct translation of the Normans' locational surname "de la Haye", meaning "of La Haye", La Haye ("the hedge") being the name of several towns on the Cotentin peninsula of Normandy, France. The first Norman namebearer to arrive in Scotland was William II de la Haye in the time of the Norman invasion. Clan Hay descends from him.Citation: Hayes surname group.
