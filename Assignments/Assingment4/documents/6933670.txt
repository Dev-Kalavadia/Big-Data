Title: Camorino

Camorino is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

On 2 April 2017 the former municipalities of Claro, Giubiasco, Gnosca, Gorduno, Gudo, Moleno, Monte Carasso, Pianezzo, Preonzo, Sant'Antonio and Sementina merged into the municipality of Bellinzona.

==History==
From time immemorial the inhabitants of Isone regularly crossed the Tiglio alpine pass to arrive in the Camorino area, where they owned vineyards and arable land.  Over the centuries, many of them finally created a village.  Camorino is first mentioned in 1237 as part of the lands of the collegiate church of S. Pietro in Bellinzona.  A church is mentioned in the village in 1237 and 1285, but no visible traces have been preserved.  The existing parish church of San Martino was built in 1553 and completely renovated in 1888.  In 1583, the village church split from the Bellinzona parish and was confirmed in 1591 as a separate parish.

In 1853 a defensive line between Sementina and Camorino was built to create jobs for the citizen of Ticino expelled from the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.  The Fortini della fame, five round towers with arrow slits in the upper part, is part of these fortifications.

Camorino was originally a pure farming village (raising mostly grapes, strawberries and livestock) with some handicraft, trade and light industry (manufacturing knitwear and pasta as well as a mill).  Due to the lack of jobs, some of whose inhabitants emigrated to America.  The population growth coincides with the growth of the cities of Giubiasco and Bellinzona.  Today it is a residential community with many commuters, with no large industrial companies and with very little agriculture.
