The company secured the Australian agency for Avro aircraft, assembling a number of Avro 504K aircraft. The Broadsmith-designed Broadsmith B.1 (as AA & E Commercial B1) was also built by the company. This aircraft was a 6-seat biplane.

==Bankruptcy==
The company went bankrupt in 1922 whilst building six 504Ks for the Royal Australian Air Force, and went into liquidation in March 1923.
