==Name==
The etymology of Macuspana's name is uncertain. The Enciclopedia de los municipios de México offers three possible explanations:
*From the Nahuatl Macui-chpana, meaning "place of the five sweepings" or "place of the five cleansings".
*From the Zoque Macu-pane, meaning "place where the priest goes".
*A corruption of the given names Marcos and Juana, presumably the founders of the settlement.
