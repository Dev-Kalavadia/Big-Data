Title: Dalpe



Dalpe is a municipality in the district of Leventina in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
In Dalpe a small cemetery from a 5th Century BC Golasecca culture settlement was discovered.  Dalpe is first mentioned in 1217 as Albe. In the 13th Century the Gotthard route went through Faido to Cornon and Prato.  Dalpe and Cornon formed a Degagna within the Vicinanza of Prato.

The church is first mentioned in 1338, the church in Cornon is from the late 15th Century.  In 1640, Dalpe broke away from the parish of Prato and became an independent parish.  The parish church of SS Bernardo e Carlo is from 1661.

In 1866, the Vicinanza of Dalpe separated from Prato and formed a separate civil parish.  Due to emigration to France, the population decreased strongly in the 2nd half of the 19th Century.  It wouldn't increase until 1941–1960, when it increased slightly, due to the establishment of a construction company.  Road construction starting in 1957 made Dalpe into an attractive summer resort in the Levantine and promoted the construction of second homes.  The first road to the village opened in 1904.  In 1940, a marble quarry opened, but closed shortly thereafter due to the war.  For centuries cattle have been the main source of revenue, but now it employs only a few families.  In 1998, the municipality began building a small hydroelectric power plant, which is fed by the river Piumogna.
