==NASA career==

Selected as a pilot by NASA in July 2000, Colonel Garan reported for training in August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station and Shuttle Operations Branches.

In April 2006, Garan became an aquanaut through his participation in the joint NASA-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NEEMO 9 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) project, an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory. During this eighteen-day mission, the six-person crew of NEEMO 9 developed lunar surface exploration procedures and telemedical technology applications in support of the United States' Vision for Space Exploration.  Ron Garan completed his first space flight in 2008 on STS-124 as mission specialist 2 for ascent and entry, and has logged over 13 days in space and 27 hours and 3 minutes of EVA in four spacewalks.

==Spaceflight experience==

* STS-124 Discovery (May 31 to June 14, 2008) was the 123rd Space Shuttle flight, and the 26th Shuttle flight to the International Space Station. STS-124 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and docked with the International Space Station on June 2 to deliver the Japanese Experiment Module Pressurized Module (JEM-PM) and the Japanese Remote Manipulator System. During the nine days docked to the space station, the STS-124 Shuttle astronauts delivered the 37-foot (11-meter) Kibo lab and moved the Logistics Module to its permanent home on the top of the JEM-PM. Garan accumulated 20 hours and 32 minutes of Extra-vehicular activity time in three spacewalks required to maintain the station and to prime the new Japanese module's robotic arm.

STS-124 also delivered a new station crew member, Expedition 17 Flight Engineer Greg Chamitoff. He replaced Expedition 16 Flight Engineer Garrett Reisman, who returned to Earth with the STS-124 crew. The STS-124 mission was completed in 218 orbits, traveling 5,735,643 miles in 13 days, 18 hours, 13 minutes and 7 seconds.

* Ron Garan's second mission was as a crew member on Expedition 27/28. His Soyuz TMA-21 launch craft was named Gagarin in honor of the 50th anniversary, eight days after its launch on April 4, of the first human spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin. Garan participated in the last space-shuttle-based spacewalk during the STS-135 mission, accumulating an additional 6 hours and 31 minutes of Extra-vehicular activity time. He returned to Earth aboard TMA-21 on September 16, 2011.

The Soyuz TMA-21 "Gagarin" descent module is in permanent exhibition at the German Titov Museum in Polkovnikovo, Altai Kray, Siberia.

==Spirituality==
Before his flight aboard Discovery in 2008, Garan asked the women religious of a Carmelite community in New Caney, Texas, for their prayers and told them he could take an item into space for them. The sisters gave him relics of St. Thérèse of Lisieux, and quoted her words:


I have the vocation of an apostle. I would like to travel over the whole earth to preach your name and to plant your glorious cross on infidel soil. But oh, my beloved, one mission would not be enough for me, I would want to preach the Gospel on all five continents simultaneously and even to the most remote isles. I would be a missionary, not for a few years but from the beginning of creation until the consummation of the ages.


Garan is the founder of the Manna Energy Foundation, which is assisting the villages of Rwanda to make potable water.

On June 24, 2009, Garan met Pope Benedict XVI at his general audience.

==Post-NASA career==

In 2014, Garan retired from NASA to work on communicating what he called the "Orbital Perspective". He has published a book called The Orbital Perspective - Lessons in Seeing the Big Picture from a Journey of 71 Million Miles and is working on a documentary called Orbital.
 
On February 23, 2016, World View Enterprises has announced that Ron Garan will be chief pilot for current robotic flight operations and upcoming human spaceflights via balloon.
