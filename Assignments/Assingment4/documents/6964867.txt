== Music video ==
Hype Williams directed the music video from October 13–14, 1999, which features Elliott singing and rapping in a huge arena, intercut with clips of dancers and strobe lights. Williams also used a vast amount of pyrotechnics, primarily used in the fast cuts to important figures in the video.  Cameos include Mary J. Blige, Ginuwine, and Timbaland. Nas and Eve were featured, but Q-Tip did not appear in the video. His section was replaced with Elliott's rap verse from the original version.
