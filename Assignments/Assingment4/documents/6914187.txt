I was out of football for a year with injury when Pat Scully gave me a chance last year. I did well enough to earn a contract in England. Some of the players here were inexperienced last year but have come a long way in the last 12 months, I've been around a few years now and the set up here, on and off the pitch is absolutely top-class, Pat O'Sullivan can take a lot of credit for that, what he's doing for soccer in Limerick is unbelievable.
