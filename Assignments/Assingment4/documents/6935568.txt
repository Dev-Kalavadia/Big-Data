The common thread of the nineteen years of Tigert's administration was doing more with less. Faculty salary cuts were common; Tigert himself never drew his full authorized annual salary of $10,000.  Among Tigert's many significant reforms, he decentralized the university budget to the level of the individual academic colleges, allowing them to set their own spending priorities.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 29.  The University Council, composed of the president, the registrar and the college deans, retained final approval authority.  Tigert also established the faculty senate, the Institute of Inter-American Affairs and the Bureau of Economic and Business Research.

One of his most influential reforms as president was the founding of the new University College as an academic division within the University of Florida in 1935.Pleasants, Gator Tales, pp. 29–30. University College was first known as General College. The college was modeled on the general education college at the University of Chicago, and administered the freshman and sophomore-year liberal arts education of undergraduates before they were accepted to the university schools or colleges that administered their academic majors. The college's stated purpose was to "stimulate intellectual curiosity" and "encourage independent work", with new liberal arts requirements in biology, English language and literature, the humanities, logic, mathematics, physical sciences and social sciences, and thereby counter the growing trend toward "trade school" education at the university level.University College was disbanded, and its role in administering the liberal arts education of underclassmen was assumed by the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences in 1978. Proctor & Langley, Gator History, p. 58.

As a former university athlete and coach, Tigert took a particular interest in athletics-related policy issues while he was president and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Florida Gators sports program generally, and football in particular.Pleasants, Gator Tales, pp. 31–32. He was responsible for the construction of the university's first and only permanent football stadium, Florida Field, in 1930.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 31. He borrowed $10,000 to begin construction of the stadium, and then raised $118,000 to pay the construction costs of the 22,800-seat facility. Tigert also hired Blake R. Van Leer as Dean to expand the engineering program and manage all applications for federal funding. Van Leer also chaired the advanced planning committee setup by Tigert.http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0005121/smith_l.pdf   Tigert was also instrumental in the organization of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), which the University of Florida joined as one of the thirteen founding institutions in December 1932. Tigert subsequently served two terms as SEC president (1934–1936 and 1945–1947). As a key leader within the SEC, he worked to impose a uniform set of rules and standards for academic eligibility for SEC athletes. Appalled by the under-the-table payments to amateur college athletes that were prevalent at the time, he advocated the grant of scholarships to athletes which would become the grant-in-aid of other university athletic programs and as mandated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the years to follow.Fred Russell, "Columnary Craft: Pioneer of Open Aid ", NCAA News, p. 2 (December 15, 1970). Retrieved February 14, 2010.

Like his predecessor, Albert A. Murphree, Tigert was elected president of the National Association of State Universities, serving from 1939 to 1940.University of Kentucky Alumni Association, Hall of Distinguished Alumni, John James Tigert . Retrieved February 14, 2010.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, students began to withdraw from the university in large numbers to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces.Proctor & Langley, Gator History, p. 38. The financial impact on the university had the potential to be devastating, but Tigert navigated the war years by making the university campus, dormitories and class rooms available for the training of U.S. Army Air Force flight crews. Tigert kept the lights on, and the bills paid. Veterans began to return to school with support from the GI Bill, and by the fall term of 1946, over seventy percent of the University of Florida's 7,000 students were returning World War II veterans.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 32. Contributing to the shortage of facility space was the influx of new female students when the Florida Legislature reinstituted co-education in 1947.Proctor & Langley, Gator History, p. 39. The university suddenly had more students than its available housing and classroom space could serve.Proctor & Langley, Gator History, pp. 38–39.



Tigert resigned as university president in 1947, worked as an educational consultant to the government of India as a member of its University Education Commission, and taught philosophy at the University of Miami until 1959.

====Legacy====
Tigert served as president of the University of Florida for nineteen years, longer than any of the other presidents of the university.Pleasants, Gator Tales, p. 34. During his term, the university awarded its first doctoral degrees in 1934, a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was installed in 1938, and total student enrollment grew from 2,162 in 1928 to over 7,500 in 1947.Proctor & Langley, Gator History, pp. 35–38. As university president, he was responsible for significant and lasting academic, athletic and administrative reforms.See, generally, Proctor & Langley, Gator History, pp. 34–39.

In recognition of Tigert's long service as its president through depression and war, the University of Florida awarded him an honorary degree, a doctor of letters, during its 1953 centennial celebration,Associated Press, "7 Honorary Degrees to be Conferred", Daytona Beach Morning Journal, p. 6 (March 10, 1953). Retrieved March 8, 2010The highest academic degree Tigert completed was a master of arts degree, but he was the recipient of at least five other honorary doctorates before his appointment as president of the University of Florida. See University of Kentucky Alumni Association, Hall of Distinguished Alumni, John James Tigert .

Tigert, 82, Educator, Is Dead: Ex-head of U. of Florida and Federal Commissioner", The New York Times (January 22, 1965). He was survived by his wife Edith, their son and daughter, and five grandchildren.

As a fitting final tribute to a professor, education reformer and administrator, who also fervently supported college sports, Tigert was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as an "Honorary Letter Winner,"F Club, Hall of Fame, Honorary Letterwinners . Retrieved May 28, 2010. and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1970.
