==Geography==
The district is located on both banks of the Northern Dvina and its main right tributary, the Vychegda. The Northern Dvina and the Vychegda divide the district into three comparably sized areas.

A major part of the district belongs to the basins of the Northern Dvina and the Vychegda, including such major tributaries of the Northern Dvina as the Ustya (left) and the Uftyuga (right). The rivers in the southeastern corner of the district (i. e., areas south of the town of Koryazhma) drain into the Lala, a tributary of the Luza, in the basin of the Yug.

Almost the whole territory of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga).

==History==
The area in general was populated by speakers of Uralic languages and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. Solvychegodsk was founded in the 14th century. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate, and Solvychegodsk was designated as one of the cities. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. The latter was abolished in 1796, and the part of it which included Solvychegodsk was made into Vologda Governorate. In 1918, the area was transferred to the newly established Northern Dvina Governorate, and in 1924 the uyezds were abolished in favor of the new divisions, the districts (raions).

Kotlassky District was formed on June 25, 1924 and included areas of former Solvychegodsky and Velikoustyugsky Uyezds. In 1928, it was merged with Solvychegodsky District and in 1931, a part of Krasnoborsky District was appended to Kotlassky District.

In the following years, the district remained in the same borders (with the exception of Solvychegodsky District, which was split out in 1938 and merged back in 1958), but the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1929, Northern Dvina Governorate was merged into Northern Krai, which in 1936 was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Kotlassky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since.
