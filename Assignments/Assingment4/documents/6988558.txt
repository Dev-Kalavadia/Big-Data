The unicursal hexagram is a hexagram or six-pointed star that can be traced or drawn unicursally, in one continuous line rather than by two overlaid triangles. The hexagram can also be depicted inside a circle with the points touching it. It is often depicted in an interlaced form with the lines of the hexagram passing over and under one another to form a knot. It is a specific instance of the far more general shape discussed in Blaise Pascal's 1639 Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem.

== Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Trinity in his mathesis ==
In his work titled Essays Upon the Mathematics of Mordente: One Hundred and Sixty Theses/Articles Against the Mathematicians and Philosophers of this Age, Italian-Dominican cosmotical theorist, Hermetic occultist, mathematician and philosophist Giordano Bruno used the unicursal hexagram symbol to represent Figura Amoris ("figure of love") part of the Hermetic Trinity in his mathesis.

== Thelema ==

In Aleister Crowley's Thelema, the hexagram is usually depicted with a five-petalled flower in the centre which symbolises a pentacle. The symbol itself is the equivalent of the ancient Egyptian Ankh, or the Rosicrucian's Rose Cross; which represents the microcosmic forces (the pentacle, representation of the pentagram with 5 elements, the Pentagrammaton, YHSVH or Yahshuah) interweave with the macro-cosmic forces (the hexagram, the representation of the planetary or heavenly cosmic forces, the divine).
