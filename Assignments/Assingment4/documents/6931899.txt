Title: Knobstone Trail

The Knobstone Trail is the longest hiking trail in Indiana.  Its southern terminus is about  north of Louisville, Kentucky in the Deam Lake State Recreation Area.  It currently ends at Delaney Creek Park near Salem, Indiana. However, there are plans to eventually extend the trail another  north to Martinsville, Indiana.  Most of the trail lies within Clark State Forest.  As it lies along the Knobstone Escarpment, it is a difficult hike, which is why many use the Knobstone Trail to prepare for hiking the Appalachian Trail.

The trail was first established in 1980, and was only  long.  It now runs , mostly through public forest.

Hiking the trail in its entirety results in approximately  of elevation change between the gains and losses. The trail passes through 3 counties and is surrounded by approximately  of Indiana State Forest. The rugged trail consists of steep climbs and descents throughout its duration. It is maintained to backcountry standards. There are no designated camp sites; rather hikers must camp at least  from roads and trailheads.

After a tornado on March 2, 2012, destroyed 4.5 miles of the trail, sections of the trail were closed.  The damaged areas were reopened in early 2014.
