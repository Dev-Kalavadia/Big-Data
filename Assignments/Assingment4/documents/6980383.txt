==Tolls==
The Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass portion of the route has tolls. Tolls are collected once during travel on the road, either at the mainline toll barrier, or at the exit or entrance point, depending on the possibility of reaching the mainline toll barrier during travel.  No toll is charged for travel between exits 0 and 1 or between exits 12 and 14. The Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable by toll-by-plate (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass. , the mainline toll barrier between exits 4 and 6 costs passenger vehicles $5.20 using toll-by-plate and $2.70 using E-ZPass. At the northbound exit and southbound entrance at exit 4 and the southbound exit and northbound entrance at exit 6, passenger vehicles are charged $4.40 using toll-by-plate and $1.80 using E-ZPass. The southbound exit and northbound entrance at exits 8 and 9 costs passenger vehicles $3.30 using toll-by-plate and $1.40 using E-ZPass.

Tolls along PA 66 were originally paid by cash or E-ZPass. At the mainline toll barrier, a staffed full service lane existed, accepting cash or credit cards. For most exit ramp tolls, exact change was required; however some automatic toll collection machines accepted paper money and gave change. All toll collecting machines gave receipts. On October 27, 2019, all-electronic tolling was implemented along the Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass section of PA 66.

Pennsylvania Route 66 Alternate (PA 66 Alt.) is an  alternate route through Westmoreland County and Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. It leaves its parent route in Washington Township. It travels through the center of Oklahoma and Vandergrift, while the mainline route bypasses residential neighborhoods along the riverfront. PA 66 Alt. merges with PA 56 to cross the Kiskiminetas River. It becomes a separate route again in Parks Township (North Vandergrift), avoiding several riverfront towns as it travels along a hilly, rural stretch, before rejoining mainline PA 66 in Bethel Township.  From 1928 to 1938, the segment from North Vandergrift to the northern terminus was designated as PA 566.

Pennsylvania Route 66 Business (PA 66 Bus.) is an  business route in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, connected two fingers of suburbia located east of Pittsburgh. The highway was signed PA 66 Business after PA 66 was shifted onto a newly created toll road bypass. The route begins nearly a mile south of the original terminus of PA 66, at a juncture with US 30 (which loops as a freeway around the city). It is cosigned with US 119 and PA 819 to the city center, before traveling on its own accord through several suburbanized miles. The route then becomes more rural, as it provides a free connection to the east-central edge of suburban Pittsburgh at Delmont. The highway is designated by PennDOT SR 0119 between US 30 and Pittsburgh Avenue in Greensburg (along the concurrency with US 119), then is part of SR 0066 north of there.
