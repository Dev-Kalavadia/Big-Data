Title: Conchagüita


Conchagüita is a volcanic island in the Gulf of Fonseca, eastern El Salvador.

In October 1892, an earthquake triggered a large landslide at the volcano, and the resulting dust cloud was first thought to be new volcanic ash. The event was discredited as volcanic eruption by the Smithsonian Institution.
