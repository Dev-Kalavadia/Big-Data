Title: Annia Cornificia Faustina


Annia Cornificia Faustina (122/123between 152 and 158) was the youngest child and only daughter of the praetor Marcus Annius Verus and Domitia Lucilla. The parents of Cornificia came from wealthy senatorial families who were of consular rank. Her brother was the future Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, and both were born and raised in Rome.

== History ==
In 124, the father of Cornificia died and she and her brother were raised by their mother and their paternal grandfather, the Roman Senator Marcus Annius Verus, who died in 138. Relations between her and her brother appeared to be good. Before Cornificia had married, she had settled her paternal inheritance with her brother.

Ronald Syme identifies her husband as one of the suffect consuls in 146, recorded in the Fasti Ostienses as Gaius Annianus Verus, but whom he claims had the full name of Gaius Ummidius Quadratus Annianus Verus. He was descended from one of the leading aristocratic and politically influential families in Rome and was a direct descendant of the late Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus, one time suffect consul.Syme, "The Ummidii", Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte, 17 (1968), pp. 98f

Cornificia bore Annianus Verus two children:
* Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus
* Ummidia Cornificia Faustina
