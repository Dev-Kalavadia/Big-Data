Title: Coat of arms of Nowy Sączthumb|Coat of arms of Nowy Sącz
The coat of arms of Nowy Sącz in Poland shows Saint Margaret the Virgin, depicting the legend that she was swallowed by Satan, in the form of a dragon, who was however forced to spit her out again because the cross she was carrying irritated the dragon's innards. In Margaret's other hand is an olive branch, a symbol of peace."Margaret of Antioch".  The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. David Hugh Farmer. Oxford University Press, 2003. Oxford Reference Online.
