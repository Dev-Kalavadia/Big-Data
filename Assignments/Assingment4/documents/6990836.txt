==History==
Crystal Beach was established in the 1960s, when the area was within Nepean Township. Primarily developed by Minto Developments Inc., many of the residences in Crystal Beach are modified versions of the five original models of homes originally built in the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood was later extended in 1974 around Carling via Corkstown Road with townhomes and in 1988 with Maki Park. Some newer portions of the neighbourhood were built by Garand Homes. 

Today, Crystal Beach is a primarily residential neighbourhood with a strong sense of community, and over the years, has become one of the most desired real-estate locations in Ottawa. Much of Crystal Beach's appeal is due to its close proximity to the Nepean Sailing Club, Andrew Haydon Park, the Carling Campus and Ottawa River, its award-winning neighbourhood design (to reduce traffic flowing through), easy access to the Queensway (Highway 417), quality schooling, community centre, and the recreational facilities within.

Together with the Lakeview neighbourhood south of Corkstown,  and the Stonehedge and Creeks End neighbourhoods east of Holly Acres Road , the area is covered by the Crystal Beach Lakeview Community Association (CBLCA).http://crystalbeachlakeview.ca/ The area north of Carling is the neighbourhood of Rocky Point, which is a partner of the CBLCA.
