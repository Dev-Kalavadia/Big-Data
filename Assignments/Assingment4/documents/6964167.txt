Title: It's Over Now (112 song)


"It's Over Now" is the lead single by 112's from third album, Part III, and their first number-one R&B single, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks for two weeks. Slim and Daron share lead vocals on the song.

The song contains an interpolation of Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five's song "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)", which was also used by the hip hop group Mobb Deep for their biggest hit "Quiet Storm" released over a year prior to "It's Over Now".

The song itself was interpolated by English singer Ellie Goulding on the song "We Can't Move To This" off of her third studio album, Delirium.
