In 1999 CariAccess Communications, Inc had applied for several licenses to provide services in the southern Caribbean-countries of Barbados, the Commonwealth of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad.  In the United States it also operated under the name Phone Line Co. based-in Atlanta, Georgia.  CariAccess has filed several legal challenges in recent years concerning the corporate policies of Cable and Wireless in the region.  These challenges were brought under the claim that C&W engages in activities that are discriminatory of competing providers in the newly liberalised telecommunications markets in the Caribbean.
