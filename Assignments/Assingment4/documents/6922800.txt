Title: Chicago and Southern Air Lines

Chicago and Southern Air Lines (C&S) was a United States airline that started life as Pacific Seaboard Air Lines in California and was organized on June 15, 1933.  Following the move from California, the airline's headquarters were initially located in St. Louis, Missouri and were then moved to Memphis, Tennessee, which also served as a hub for the carrier.http://www.timetableimages.com, June 1, 1940 Chicago & Southern Air Lines system timetable"World Airline Directory." Flight International. May 16, 1952. "Chicago and Southern Air Lines" 592.  C&S was merged into
Delta Air Lines in 1953, thus providing Delta with its first international routes.

==History==
The first service was operated by Pacific Seaboard Air Lines on June 23, 1933, in Carleton Putnam's single engine Bellanca CH-300 "Miss San Jose." Putnam held a Transport Pilot's license. Three Bellanca CH-300s were flown in the California operation. The new airline only flew passengers on the West Coast of California on "The Scenic Route." This route was up the coast of California from Los Angeles (Grand Central Air Terminal at Glendale) to San Francisco's Mills Field. Stops were made at seven destinations located near or on the Pacific Ocean including Santa Barbara, CA, Santa Maria, CA, San Luis Obispo, CA, Paso Robles, CA, Monterey, CA, Salinas, CA and San Jose, CA.http://www.timetableimages.com, Summer 1933 Pacific Seaboard Air Lines system timetable  For a short period, Pacific Seaboard Air Lines also flew from San Francisco to the capital of California, Sacramento. The primary competition on the L.A.-San Francisco route was United Airlines with twin-engine, ten-passenger, Boeing 247s. United, which also flew the San Joaquin Valley route in California, had the U.S. Air Mail contract and more comfortable aircraft. Putnam decided the only way he could stay in business was to get a U.S. Air Mail contract. In four months and one week, 1113 passengers were carried.

==Airmail operations==
On February 9, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt canceled all the U.S. Mail contracts. The U.S. Army operated the air postal service for a few weeks, and then the government called for new bids on the Air Mail routes. Putnam bid on and received the Air Mail route between Chicago and New Orleans by way of Peoria, Springfield, St. Louis, Memphis, and Jackson (Air Mail Route 8). Two more Bellanca CH-300s were purchased, bringing that fleet to five aircraft. Putnam had to start service in 30 days or forfeit his $50,000 performance bond. Air mail service started June 3, 1934, and passenger service started June 13 with the five Bellancas on "The Valley Level Route." The airline changed its name to Chicago and Southern Air Lines in 1935.  The June 1, 1940, Chicago & Southern timetable described the "Valley Level Route" as being "900 Miles of Flat Country" between Chicago and New Orleans via Memphis, with "Fine Airports" and "A Splendid Airway".http://www.timetableimages.com, June 1, 1940 Chicago & Southern Air Lines system timetable

==Passenger services==

Chicago and Southern continued flying north to south routes in the Midwest, bringing air service to smaller markets such as Evansville, Indiana, and Paducah, Kentucky. The airline acquired its first Douglas DC-3 in 1940 and continued to operate the type until the 1953 merger with Delta Air Lines.Gradidge, 2006, p. 227 Some four-engined Douglas DC-4s were also operated postwar.

From 1946, the DC-4s were used to commence international services from Houston and New Orleans to Havana, Cuba; Santo Domingo (which was known as Ciudad Trujillo from 1930 to 1961), Dominican Republic; Kingston, Jamaica and Caracas, Venezuela.Marson, 1982, p. 165  The February 1, 1947 Chicago & Southern system timetable route map includes all of these destinations as well as Aruba, Netherlands Antilles; Camaguey, Cuba; Curacao, Netherlands Antilles; Port au Prince, Haiti and San Juan, Puerto Rico; however, it appears that although passenger traffic rights may have been granted or applied for, these additional destinations were not being served at this time.http://www.airtimes.com, Feb. 1, 1947 Chicago & Southern Air Lines system timetable cover with route map

In October 1950 C&S took delivery of the first of six Lockheed L-649A Constellations. These larger pressurised airliners were placed in service from Chicago and St Louis to Houston, Memphis, New Orleans, Havana, Kingston, and Caracas.

On 10 January 1953 a new service from New Orleans to San Juan, Puerto Rico was inaugurated.Marson, 1982, p. 165  According to the C&S  timetable, this service was named the "Hai-Drico Rocket" and was operated once a week with a "New Luxury Constellation" on a southbound routing of Memphis - New Orleans - Port au Prince, Haiti - Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic (now Santo Domingo) - San Juan with the return northbound flight continuing on from Memphis to St. Louis and Chicago.http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/cs1/cs5304/cs5304-4.jpg
