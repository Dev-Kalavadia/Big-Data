Title: Deltoid ligament
The deltoid ligament (or medial ligament of talocrural joint) is a strong, flat, triangular band, attached, above, to the apex and anterior and posterior borders of the medial malleolus. 
The deltoid ligament is composed of 4 fibers:
1. Anterior tibiotalar ligament
2. Tibiocalcaneal ligament
3. Posterior tibiotalar ligament
4. Tibionavicular ligament.
It consists of two sets of fibers, superficial and deep.

==Superficial fibres==
Of the superficial fibres, 
* tibionavicular pass forward to be inserted into the tuberosity of the navicular bone, and immediately behind this they blend with the medial margin of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament; 
* tibiocalcaneal descend almost perpendicularly to be inserted into the whole length of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus; 
* posterior tibiotalar from the posterior colliculus of the medial malleolus to the posteromedial surface of the talus

==Deep fibres==
The deep fibres (anterior tibiotalar) are attached from the anterior colliculus of the medial malleolus to the medial talus and medial tubercle

==Coverings==
The deltoid ligament is covered by the tendons of the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus which are supplied by the tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3).
