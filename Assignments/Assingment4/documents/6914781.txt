==Background==
Gillis stated that with Unstoppable, "the idea was to make more original sounding hip hop type music and pop music out of samples and having some blatant samples. It was obviously more party oriented, something you could jam out to." Mark Richardson of Pitchfork notes that Unstoppable and its predecessor Secret Diary are "far noisier and much more abstract" than his subsequent releases. Gillis' production on these releases is primarily a mixture of glitch beats and samples of pop hits, but Unstoppable marks a turn towards a more "pop-oriented and accessible" approach characterized as "far more direct, using fewer and longer samples to create more recognizable mash-ups in the manner of early KLF singles".
