Title: Manna (album)


Manna is the third studio album by American soft rock band Bread, released in 1971. The title, like that of the preceding album On the Waters, is a Biblical pun on the name Bread, in this case the manna from Heaven which was fed to the Israelites. Although it was not literally bread (the word "manna" simply means "What is it?") it has often been metaphorically described as bread from Heaven. The singles "Let Your Love Go" and "If" were released from this album.
