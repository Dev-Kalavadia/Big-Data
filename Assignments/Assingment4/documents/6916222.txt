John S. Armstrong and his two sons-in-law, Edgar Flippen and Hugh Prather Sr., decided that Highland Park, Texas needed a shopping center that could function as a town square. The developers traveled to Barcelona and Seville in Spain as well as to Mexico and California, studying the architecture in order to plan a retail center for Highland Park.

They hired American architects Marion Fresenius Fooshee and James B. Cheek to design the center, which opened in 1931. After the death of Hugh Prather, Sr. in 1959, management of the Village was taken over by his sons, John Prather and Hugh Prather, Jr. In 1966, the Howard Corporation acquired the shopping center. 

In 1976, the Howard Corporation decided to sell the Village and enlisted the help of the Henry S. Miller Company. Miller had a sentimental attachment to the property because his father had been an associate of the Flippen-Prather Realty Company from 1917 to 1919 and a close friend of both partners, Hugh Prather and Edgar Flippen.
