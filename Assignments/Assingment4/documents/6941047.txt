Title: Newcastle Rugby League

The Newcastle Rugby League is a local rugby league football competition in Newcastle, Australia. It is one of the oldest rugby league competitions in Australia, founded in 1910. A Newcastle representative team was also assembled from players in the League during most of the 20th century. The first grade competition also comprises the NSWRL Presidents Cup Northern Conference.

==History==
A Newcastle team competed in the inaugural New South Wales Rugby League premiership of 1908 but withdrew after the 1909 season to form the local competition under the banner of the Northern Branch of the NSWRL.

The four original teams were Central Newcastle (Blue & White), Northern Suburbs (Light & Dark Blue vertical stripes), South Newcastle (Red & White) and Western Suburbs (Red & Green).http://users.hunterlink.net.au/~maajjs/aus/nsw/ncl/nclcomps.htm The season kicked off 14 May 1910 with South playing West and Central playing Northern Suburbs. South Newcastle finished the season on top of the ladder; the final was played in front of 2500 spectators at Hamilton League Ground, with Central overcoming South 13–4.

The 1911 season saw the previous minor premiers South slump to the bottom of the ladder. The final was played in front of 4000 spectators and saw North victorious over Central 10–2.
1911 saw the Combined Newcastle & Hunter team Tour Queensland, defeating the Queensland State team in all matches played.
Newcastle played against the touring New Zealand team in a tight match almost pulling off an upset before going down 21–20.

The 1912 season saw the addition of Eastern Suburbs, playing in Black and White. They were immediately competitive and made the grand final.

The First World War saw a halt to the competition for 1917 and 1918. Although the Newcastle Morning Herald did continue to publish results for competition games for those two years.Newcastle Morning Herald Microfiche archive, held at Newcastle University The NSW Football League sacked most of the local officials following an early game of the 1917 season in which the Western Suburbs Club played a disqualified player. The competition was thrown into turmoil and the season was abandoned. The 1918 season was also abandoned because the officials were still serving their suspensions and the player shortage had worsened. 

1919 saw a split, with two smaller competitions held – the "Lilywhites" or clubs faithful to the NSWRL, composed of Eastern Suburbs and Northern Suburbs, and the "Bolsheviks" or rebels composed of South, Central, North and West.

1920 saw the competition reunited when the Newcastle Rugby League (NRL) was officially formed and expanded to six teams as Kurri Kurri competed for the first time. The Newcastle Sports Ground (No1) was officially opened 16th September 1922 on land donated by the Australian Agricultural Company. The opening was marked between Western Suburbs (Sydney) and a Newcastle representative side, with Newcastle winning 20-16. The first game under lights was played at the Newcastle Coursing and Sporting Club (later the Newcastle Greyhound track) at Hamilton South in 1928.

The 1930s saw the emergence of the Coalfields teams (such as Cessnock Goannas in 1930). Football games were first broadcast on the radio in this decade, but only after considerable debate by Newcastle Rugby League. The record score was established in this decade on the 27th July 1939, when Northern Suburbs defeated Morpeth-East Maitland 127-16. North winger Alf Fairhall scored 11 tries and kicked 14 goals, with the game called off 20 minutes early. 

The Country Rugby League (CRL) formed in 1934 and became the governing body for the sport of rugby league in areas of New South Wales outside the Sydney metropolitan area, such as Newcastle. 

In the mid 1950s,the major football clubs were opening large licensed Social Clubs. Bar and poker machine revenue from these clubs provided a new source of cash to fund and develop the game. Also in this era, the 'six-yard rule' was introduced to keep both the attacking and defending teams from being within three yards of the play the ball. 

Prior to 1960, if the minor premiers were defeated in the playoffs, they then had the right to challenge the winner of the final to a grand final match. The Second Division competition started in 1960 with nine teams, growing to 23 for the 1961 season. Macquarie also entered the league in 1960. In 1962, the local Television station (NBN 3) began transmitting to Newcastle audiences. 

From 1963 to 1965, the Newcastle representative team won 15 consecutive matches, including wins in three Country Championships and wins against South Africa and France, and the famous victories in the State Cup. This Cup, in which Sydney teams played NSW Country Divisional teams in a knockout competition, was launched in 1964 by the NSWRL. Newcastle defeated South Sydney, North Sydney, the all-conquering St George and Parramatta to win the Cup. This side featured names such as Terry Pannowitz, Allan Buman, and Dave Brown (captain). 

In 1968, the Central Newcastle club relocated from the inner-city to Charlestown and became Central-Charlestown, popularly known as 'The Butcher Boys'. 

During the 1970s, the ten District clubs engaged in an impressive line-up of high profile Captain/Coaches. Great Britain international Terry Clawson (South Newcastle), immortal and Australian international Johnny Raper (Western Suburbs), Australian international Brian 'Chicka' Moore (Macquarie) and Australian international Alan Thomson (Lakes United), to name a few. In 1971, the 'six tackle rule' was introduced. In 1978, foundation club Northern Suburbs became North Newcastle after it enlarged its district to include Raymond Terrace and Nelson Bay. 

In 1988, the league changed majorly with the introduction of the Newcastle Knights into the NSWRL competition, the first representation of the Newcastle and Hunter region since the Newcastle Rebels departed after the 1909 season. 

As a result, the 1990s saw the Newcastle Knights attract the lion's share of the spectators in Newcastle and support for local clubs suffered. This downturn was offset to a certain extent when former Knights players began to filter into the local competition. The drift of players boosted the profile of the local league, which was no more evident than when Steve Linnane led Kurri to a trifecta of premierships in 1993, 1994 and 1995. 

The 2000s saw the league implement a 'salary cap' and a 'points system' for players signing with a 'new' club. This innovation was designed to control spending and to keep clubs alive and well. A joint venture launched in 2009 by the Knights and the Newcastle Rugby League was labelled 'the Player Placement Program', designed to allow Knights players not required by their club on a weekend, to play in the local competition.

2020 saw the competition cancelled for the first time in over one hundred years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With restrictions easing, a decision was made to implement a two tiered amateur competition. First Grade would feature Lakes United, Western Suburbs, Cessnock, Maitland, Central and Souths. Reserve Grade would see representation from Western Suburbs, Lakes United, Cessnock, Maitland, Central, Souths and Kurri Kurri. Of further note, Maitland also elected to participate in the Presidents Cup, spreading their resources across the two Newcastle competitions as well as the New South Wales based Presidents Cup, which they won. Cessnock defeated South Newcastle in the First Grade Grand Final.

The 2021 season featured the regular clubs, as well as both Wyong and The Entrance, forming a 10 team, 18 round competition. The Entrance will contest the competition for the first time in their history. As well as this, the Major Premiers also now advance to meet title winners from Illawarra, Ron Massey Cup and a wildcard in a conference style President's Cup at the end of the year.https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7050564/central-coast-clubs-set-to-join-newcastle-rl-in-2021-new-look-presidents-cup-series/?cs=14220/  Unfortunately, the competition was interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions placed on the Hunter region, with a decision made to cancel the competition prior to any finals being played. Maitland Pickers had secured the Minor Premiership, but there would be no Major Premiers for season 2021. No President's Cup tournament was contested.

Season 2022 saw the Maitland Pickers claim the minor premiership with 31 competition points,  with Central Newcastle (29), Macquarie Scorpions (22), Cessnock Goannas (22) and South Newcastle (22) rounding out the top five. On the 11th September 2022, Maitland Pickers claimed their 13th premiership with a 40-4 victory over Macquarie Scorpions at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle. On 25th September 2022, Maitland defended their Presidents Cup crown with a 36-12 win over The Hills Bulls. 2022 NSWRL Presidents Cup. 

Season 2023 will include The Northern Hawks, bumping the number of teams in the league to 11. All teams will compete in the overarching 2023 NSWRL Presidents Cup. 2023 will also see the modern-day version of the Newcastle Rebels, a team constructed of the best talent from the Newcastle Rugby League, return to the Men's Country Championships.
