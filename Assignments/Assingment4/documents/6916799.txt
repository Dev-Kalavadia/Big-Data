Title: List of Native American Medal of Honor recipients


This is a list of Native Americans awarded the nation's highest military decoration — the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is bestowed "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force."  The medal is awarded by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress.

Of the 3,469 Medals of Honor awarded as of 2010, 29 have been awarded to Native Americans.

The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.

| In battle off Samar, where a major portion of the Japanese Battle fleet surprised the Taffy 3 escort carrier task unit, Evans immediately attacked with his single destroyer, the Johnston, against overwhelming odds. At the cost of his own life, his ship, and much of his crew, they helped to inflict the amazing defeat on the enemy battleships and cruisers by a far inferior American force.
