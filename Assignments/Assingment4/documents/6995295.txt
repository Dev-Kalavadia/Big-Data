Title: Urogenital triangle

The urogenital triangle is the anterior part of the perineum.  In female mammals, it contains the vagina and associated parts of the internal genitalia.

==Structure==
The urogenital triangle is the area bound by a triangle with one vertex at the pubic symphysis and the two other vertices at the iliac tuberosities of the pelvic bone.

==Components==
As might be expected, the contents of the urogenital triangle differ greatly between the male and the female. Some of the components include:Daftary, Shirish; Chakravarti, Sudip (2011). Manual of Obstetrics, 3rd Edition. Elsevier. pp. 1-16. .
