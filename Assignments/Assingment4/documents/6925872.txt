Title: Transformers: Zone




 is a Japanese original video animation (OVA) in the fictional Transformers universe. It was released on July 21, 1990, on VHS and on April 21, 2004, on DVD in Japan. An unofficial fan-made English dub was released on TFCog.com in March 2004.

==Story==
Following on from Victory, the mysterious three-faced insectoid being, Violen Jiger dispatches the "Nine Great Demon Generals"—Devastator, Menasor, Bruticus, Trypticon, Predaking, Abominus, King Poseidon, Overlord and BlackZarak—to acquire "Zone Energy", destroying the planet Feminia to obtain the world's store and in search of the powerful Zodiac. Caught in the destruction of the planet, Star Saber is rescued by Dai Atlas, who then repels an attack by the Destrons on Earth, and is appointed the new Cybertron commander at the conclusion of the episode, following a battle with the Destrons and unlocking the power of the Zodiac that was found on Earth.

==Characters==
The cast of Zone is composed heavily of Micromasters, who also made up much of the toyline. Dai Atlas is a "Powered Master", so named for his motorized gimmick, as is his combining partner Sonic Bomber—the toyline also featured another partner for them, Roadfire, who was not in the episode. The solitary Decepticons in the toyline were the Race Track Patrol, and Metrotitan, a redeco of the Autobot city Metroplex, neither of whom appeared in animated form. None of the Decepticon Generals ever appeared in toy form.

==Development==
Originally intended to be a full TV series, Transformers: Zone was forced to become direct-to-video (OVA) due to less than expected toy sales. The series was cancelled after just one episode at 25 minutes.  It is considered the last TF Generation 1 animated movie and the last series in the Japanese Transformers Generation 1 saga.

==Adaptations==
The missing characters did go on to appear in the pages of the Japanese publication, TV Magazine otherwise known as Telemaga. This monthly magazine had always included Transformers manga story pages and splash illustrations with explanatory text. No direct manga was ever released for Zone. TV Magazine did publish a retelling on the OVA in manga format in its April 1990 issue.

These story pages were used to provide supporting fiction for the remaining two years' worth of toylines—1991's Battlestars: Return of Convoy and 1992's Operation: Combination.
