Bomb (stylized in all caps as BOMB) is an American arts magazine edited by artists and writers, published quarterly in print and daily online.

In addition to interviews, Bomb publishes reviews of literature, film, and music, as well as new poetry and fiction. Bomb is published by New Art Publications, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.New Art Publications, Inc.

==History==
Bomb was launched in 1981 by a group of New York City-based artists, including Betsy Sussler, Sarah Charlesworth, Glenn O'Brien, Michael McClard, and Liza Béar, who sought to record and promote public conversations between artists without mediation by critics or journalists.McClister, Nell.

The name Bomb is a reference to both Wyndham Lewis' Blast and the fact that the magazine's original editors expected the publication to "bomb" after one or two issues. Shortly after its founding, Bomb formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, New Art Publications, Inc., which publishes the journal.

In 2005, the Bomb offices moved from the SoHo neighborhood of New York City, New York, to Fort Greene, Brooklyn. By December 2019, Bomb had published one hundred fifty issues.
