Title: Fascia adherens
In anatomy for cardiac muscle, fascia adherens are ribbon-like structures that stabilize non-epithelial tissue. They are similar in function and structure to the zonula adherens or adherens junction of epithelial cells. It is a broad intercellular junction in the transversal sections of an intercalated disc of cardiac muscle anchoring actin filaments. It helps to transmit contractile forces.Histology" A Text and Atlas with Correlated Cell and Molecular Biology by Michael H. Ross and Mojciech Pawlina 5th edition
