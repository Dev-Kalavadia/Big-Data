====Hosted regattas====

* 1958: In 1958 the Lipton Cup Regatta was hosted by Algoa Bay Yacht Club. After winning the Lipton Cup in Cape Town in 1957 in Trickson II, the skipper Harold Kohler (sailing under the burgee of Redhouse Yacht Club) nominated Algoa Bay as the defence's sailing area. The 1958 Lipton Cup regatta was won by Wilf Hancock from Durban.
* 1962: In 1962 the Lipton Cup fleet returned to Algoa Bay as a result of the nomination of ABYC by Noel Horsfield, the winner of the 1961 Lipton Cup, a fleet of 30 Sq’s competed for the Lipton Cup and for the first time ABYC had an entry – Paddy Goodall’s “Sunmaid”. Harold Kohler was in there again with “Trickson II” under the Redhouse burgee while Graham Packer represented Zwartkops. None of these three local entries managed to win the event and the competition was not held in Algoa Bay waters again until 1998.
* 1972: In 1972 the RCOD and Soling classes held their National Championships on the bay with ABYC hosting the event.
* 1975: During 1975 ABYC's annual regatta “Algoa Bay Week” was established - a regatta that has been held every year since then. The first one was prefaced by a boat show held at the swimming bath at St.George’s Park. A small yacht was launched into the swimming bath itself for inspection by the public, various displays of yachting equipment were laid out and entertainment was provided by the Grey High School band. The NSRI together with the South African Air Force performed a rescue operation. An inflatable dinghy floated in the swimming pool and from it a patient was air lifted into a helicopter.
