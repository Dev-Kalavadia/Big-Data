Title: Holikachuk language



Holikachuk (own name: Doogh QinagBeth R. Leonard (2007), Deg Xinag oral traditions: reconnecting indigenous language and education through traditional narratives, a thesis presented to the Faculty
of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, May 2007) was an Athabaskan language formerly spoken at the village of Holikachuk (Hiyeghelinhdi) on the Innoko River in central Alaska. In 1962, residents of  Holikachuk relocated to Grayling on the lower Yukon River. Holikachuk is intermediate between the Deg Xinag and Koyukon languages, linguistically closer to Koyukon but socially much closer to Deg Xinag. Though it was recognized by scholars as a distinct language as early as the 1840s, it was only definitively identified in the 1970s.Krauss, Michael E. 1973. Na-Dene.

 Of about 180 Holikachuk people, only about 5 spoke the language in 2007.Krauss, Michael E. 2007. Native languages of Alaska.

James Kari compiled a short dictionary of Holikachuk in 1978, but Holikachuk remains one of the least documented Alaska Native languages.Kari, James. 1978. Holikachuk Noun Dictionary (Preliminary). Fairbanks: Alaska Native Language Center. ERIC ED172528
