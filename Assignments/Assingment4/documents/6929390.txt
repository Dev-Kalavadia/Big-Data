Title: Precious Friend


Precious Friend is a record by Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seeger with Shenandoah (produced by John Pilla) and a Warner Bros. recording.

Precious Friend was  recorded in 1981 at the Poplar Creek Music Theater, Pine Knob Music Theatre (DTE Energy Music Theatre), Greek Theatre and Concord Pavilion. It is a compilation of songs from when Guthrie and Seeger toured together. Some of its most famous songs are: "Kisses Sweeter than Wine", made famous by The Weavers, "If I Had a Hammer", and a multi- religious "Old Time Religion".

Arlo also has a few "songs" that are more just him telling stories and thinking out loud. Pete has one too. The song Sailin' Up, Sailin' Down is based on his Hudson River Sloop Clearwater to clean up the Hudson River in the 1960s and beyond. They also perform three of Woody Guthrie's songs.
