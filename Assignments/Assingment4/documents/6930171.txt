Title: 2006 Tennessee Titans season


The 2006 Tennessee Titans season was the franchise’s 47th season overall, 37th with the league, and tenth in Tennessee. The season began with the Titans trying to improve on the 4–12 record from their 2005 season. The team improved to 8–8, but missed the playoffs for the third consecutive season.

The Titans signed Pittsburgh Steelers safety Chris Hope, Indianapolis Colts linebacker David Thornton, New England Patriots wide receiver David Givens, New York Jets center Kevin Mawae, Oakland Raiders quarterback Kerry Collins, and brought back defensive lineman Robaire Smith after he was released by the Houston Texans.

The Titans, with the third 2006 overall pick, chose Vince Young, star quarterback out of the University of Texas, and with their second round pick, picked USC running back LenDale White. Then, they used the rest of their picks on Penn St. Safety Calvin Lowry, North Carolina St. LB Stephen Tulloch, Miami University (OH) LB Terna Nande, Tennessee DT Jesse Mahelona, Wisconsin WR Jonathan Orr, Samford DB Cortland Finnegan, Utah LB Spencer Toone, and Utah RB Quinton Ganther.

However, the Titans were winless for five consecutive games before winning their first game against the Redskins in week 6.

This was also the final season where Floyd Reese was general manager for the Titans as he resigned following the season.
