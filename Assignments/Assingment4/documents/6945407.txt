Title: Kodiak (TV series)
Kodiak is a half-hour adventure program (produced by Warner Bros. TV) that aired Friday evenings at 8:00 p.m Eastern time on ABC during the 1974-1975 television season. The show filled the time spot left vacant by ABC's cancellation of The Brady Bunch.

The show revolved around the main character of Cal "Kodiak" McKay (played by Clint Walker), an Alaska State Trooper.Terrace, Vincent (2011). Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010.

The show received unfavorable reviews from critics like John J. O'Connor who called it a "disaster" and wrote that its premiere episode was "about as interesting as watching a large block of polluted ice."O'Connor, John J.

It suffered low ratings due to being scheduled opposite NBC's mega-hit Sanford and Son. Kodiak was cancelled after the first episode, although a total of four episodes were aired. The show was filmed in Bend, Oregon, using the Old Skyliners Ski Lodge as the primary meeting place.

Abner Biberman portrayed Imhook, and Maggie Blye had the role of police radio dispatcher Mandy.
