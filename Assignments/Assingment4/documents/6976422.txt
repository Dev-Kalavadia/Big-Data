==History==
thumb|Danbury Hospital, circa 1930
Founded in 1885, Danbury Hospital was a small community hospital for its first 50 years. Its School of Nursing was established in 1893, and the first graduate medical education (GME) program was a one-year general internship approved in 1926.

In 1970 the hospital developed a long-range strategic plan which included a proposal to make the hospital a regional teaching hospital. A full-time faculty was formed and eventually evolved into the multi-specialty, not-for-profit practice called Danbury Office of Physician Services, PC.

A three-story addition (Stroock Tower) and a two level parking garage opened in January 1985.

On June 20, 2014, a new 11 story, 316,000 sf addition to the hospital (The Peter and Carmen Lucia Buck Pavilion) was opened.
