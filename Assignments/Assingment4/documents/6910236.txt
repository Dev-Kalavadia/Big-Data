Title: Baseball Hobby News

Baseball Hobby News was a United States-based news-oriented magazine about the field of baseball memorabilia collecting. Founded in 1979 by the husband-and-wife team of Frank and Vivian Barning, who served as editor and publisher, respectively, the magazine was published on a monthly basis until 1993.

== Overview ==
The first issue appeared in March 1979. Vivian Barning has been a card collector as a child, and came back to the hobby with her husband in 1975. For most of its run, it appeared in a newspaper-style format, although it later converted to a tabloid size with a color cover.

The magazine primarily focussed on baseball cards, but also included coverage of many other baseball-related collectibles, including autographs, press pins, postcards, stamps, uniforms and other pieces of game-used equipment, and books and other publications. As its name implies, the paper placed an emphasis on news, offering extensive coverage of newly released cards and memorabilia, as well as reporting on developments within the hobby itself. It also featured more nostalgic pieces, including articles on older memorabilia as well as interviews with baseball players of the past. There were also frequent articles aimed at new collectors, offering advice on how to get started in the hobby.

The publication originally was based in Glen Cove, New York. It moved to San Diego, California in 1982. The Barnings wrote many articles themselves, but also used contributions from a growing staff of writers and columnists.

In 1982 the packaging of Fleer's baseball card set touted that their 1981 set had been named the best of the year by Baseball Hobby News.

Some of the regular features in Baseball Hobby News for at least parts of its run include:

* Lists of addresses of professional players, for collectors to use in seeking autographs, often compiled by John L. Raybin.
