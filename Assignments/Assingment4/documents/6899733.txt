Title: Household Saints

Household Saints is a 1993 film starring Tracey Ullman, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lili Taylor.  It is based on the novel by Francine Prose and directed by Nancy Savoca.  The film explores the lives of three generations of Italian-American women over the course of the latter half of the 20th century. The film's executive producer is Jonathan Demme, a long-time friend of Savoca's, and her first real employer in the world of film.

==Plot==
The film follows the courtship and marriage of Catherine Falconetti to local butcher Joseph Santangelo, as well as Catherine's relationship with her overbearing Old World mother-in-law, Carmela.

The film also focuses on Catherine and Joseph's daughter Teresa, a devout Catholic more similar to her superstitious grandmother than her modernized and secularized parents. As a child and young adult, Terersa puts herself through a series of trials so that she might one day be canonized as a saint. Teresa's teenage fantasy to become a nun is strained after starting a relationship with a marriage-minded young man.

The film explores both family dynamics over the course of time as well as, on a larger level, the relationship between religious faith in miracles and modernity.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Household Saints has an approval rating of 54% based on 13 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and called it a "warm-hearted jewel of a movie" with many scenes that rang true to his Catholic upbringing. He added Savoca "wants to show how, in only three generations, an Italian family that is comfortable with the mystical turns into an American family that is threatened by it. And she wants to explore the possibilities of sainthood in these secular days. That she sees great humor in her subject is perfect; it is always easier to find the truth through laughter."
