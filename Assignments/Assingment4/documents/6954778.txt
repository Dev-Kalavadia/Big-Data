== Plot ==
Raja Vikramarka is the prince of Skanda Dweepam, a small kingdom. As he is a prince, he is not allowed to live his own free life. His father Raja Bhupathi arranges his marriage with another kingdom's princess. She turns out to be nothing more than a sycophant, one without a brain or spine of her own. Vikramarka leaves the kingdom along with his trusted friend, Jockie, to live his own life. In the modern big city, he finds a friend and works as a mechanic, during which time he saves a woman Rekha from two attempts on her life. Her uncle Vishwanatham hires him as her bodyguard. Vishwanatham later reveals to him that he was in fact the assassin trying to kill her for her money. To thwart his plot, Vikramarka agrees to handle the murder attempts, while at the same time trying to save her. After being thrown out of the house, Vishwanatham, along with his allies Kanaka Rao and Raja Kotappa join forces to kill Vikramarka and his parents. Vikramarka saves the day and rules as king of his land.
