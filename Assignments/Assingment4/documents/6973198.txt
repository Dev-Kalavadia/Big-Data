Title: Sung Noen district
Sung Noen (, ) is a district (amphoe) in western part of Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeastern Thailand.

==History==
The  literal translation of Sung Noen is 'high hills', as the area has two high (sung) hills (noen) beside a pond, and has never been flooded. Sung Noen was the location of two ancient cities, Mueang Sema and Khorakha (Khorat) Pura.Pali púra became Sanskrit puri, hence Thai บุรี, บูรี () all connoting the same as Thai mueang: city with defensive wall 

Historians believe that Sung Noen is Mueang Rat, a city under the rule of Pho Khun Pha Mueang, one of the rulers who played a great role in establishing the Sukhothai Kingdom, at the beginning of Thai history.

When the Northeastern railway was finished in 1901, the community consisting of Ban Sung Noen grew due to the passing of the railway. Thus the government raised Sung Noen to district status.
