==1985 match against China PR==

Kwok later became the coach of the Hong Kong football team, guiding the team to a decisive victory against China PR by 2-1 at the Workers Stadium in Beijing, China on 19 May 1985, during a 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifying game.

Although the two teams drew 0-0 in their first match in Hong Kong, China PR was considered to be stronger and was favoured to win the group. Due to superior goal difference, China only needed a draw to proceed to the next round. However, a 20-yard freekick by Hong Kong's Cheung Chi Tak (張志德) opened the scoring. China PR replied with Li Hui (李輝)'s goal but another well taken goal by Ku Kam Fai (顧錦輝) sealed the win for Hong Kong and sent China PR out of the 1986 World Cup.

The loss to Hong Kong delayed China PR's World Cup entry for another 16 years before they finally appeared in Korea Japan 2002. After the game, Chinese fans rioted outside the stadium, while the Hong Kong team received a heroic welcome at the Kai Tak Airport.

The victory was passionately remembered by Hong Kong football fans as "The 5.19 Victory".
