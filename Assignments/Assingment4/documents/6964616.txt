Title: Billy Holm


William Frederick Holm (July 21, 1912 – July 27, 1977) was a Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Chicago Cubs (1943–1944) and Boston Red Sox (1945).  A native of Chicago, he stood 5'10½" and weighed 168 lbs.

In a career total of 119 games he hit .156 (44-for-282, 39 singles) with 15 runs batted in and 22 runs scored.  41 walks, however, did push his on-base percentage up to .272.  He made 8 errors in 417 chances for a fielding percentage of .981.
