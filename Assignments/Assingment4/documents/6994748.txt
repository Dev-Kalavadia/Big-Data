Title: Go – The Very Best of Moby

Go – The Very Best of Moby is a compilation album by American electronic musician Moby, released in 2006. Various versions of the album were released around the world with different track listings, including single-disc versions containing hit singles, and two-disc versions which include singles plus a second disc of (mainly) remixes. The previously unreleased "New York, New York" featuring vocals by Debbie Harry, is also included in the release.



== Remixed ==


A remix album, Go – The Very Best of Moby: Remixed was released in March 2007. All of the tracks are remixes of Moby's work by other producers and remixers, apart from track 17, which is a remix Moby himself produced.

The tracks are not mixed into each other, but most of them are edits of the original remixes. Editing is credited to RJ, James Aparicio, David Loudoun, and Saxo. The digital download version omits tracks 16 and 17.

==Track listing==

Five different versions of Go – The Very Best of Moby were released in different regions of the world.  Each version contains different songs, based on the singles and their popularity in that region.  All songs are edited versions of the album mixes, unless noted.

; Single-disc editions
A single-disc version of the album was released in the United Kingdom, France, and South America. The Danish single-disc version is similar to the South American one except it does not include "Bodyrock" and "Beautiful". The two-disc international deluxe edition was also available for sale in these regions for an additional price.
