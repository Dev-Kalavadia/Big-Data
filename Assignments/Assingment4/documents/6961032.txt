Title: Don't Just Lie There, Say Something!


Don't Just Lie There, Say Something! is a 1974 British politically-themed comedy film based on a popular "Whitehall farce" written by Michael Pertwee, who also wrote the screenplay.

In the film, a government minister and his best friend take action in parliament against permissive behaviour in the United Kingdom. They are opposed by a group of hippies, who try to discredit them. Meanwhile the minister is trying to maintain sexual relations with two different women, while keeping his sexual life hidden from the public.

==Plot summary==
Sir William Mainwaring-Brown, a British Government Minister, puts forward a parliamentary Bill to battle 'filth' (permissive behaviour) in the UK. However, that does not stop him having an affair with Wendy (the wife of a high-up reporter)—as well as planning a one-night-stand with his secretary Miss Parkyn, having discovered that her boyfriend has gone away. Opponents of the Bill – mainly some hippies, led by Johnny – decide to kidnap the Minister's best friend and co-sponsor of the Bill, Barry Ovis, just as he is on the way to the church to marry his fiancée, Jean.

The intention is to discredit Barry Ovis by making it appear that he was involved in an orgy, thus removing any credibility that the Law and Order Bill might have had. Following a tip-off by Edith, one of the conspirators, the police raid the hippies' flat. Thankfully for Barry, he escapes before the police discover him and dashes back to Sir William's flat, followed by Edith.

Meanwhile, the Minister is also trying to use the flat to carry on his seduction of Miss Parkyn, only for Wendy to also appear by surprise. The Minister, Barry and Jean try to keep the truth from Inspector Ruff (Who is searching for the missing Ovis), Wilfred Potts (an elderly anti-sleaze MP, who is staying temporarily in the adjoining flat) and Birdie (the Minister's wife). Not only that, but they have to try to deal with the hippies who do their utmost to discredit Mainwaring-Brown and Ovis. Naturally this causes no end of trouble.

Radio Times was similarly scathing, stating the film "reduces the precise timing of the double entendres, the bedroom entrances and exits and the dropped-trouser misunderstandings to the level of clumsy contrivance, which not even the slickest of players can redeem".
