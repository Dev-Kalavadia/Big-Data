Title: On the Waters


On the Waters is the second album by Bread, released in July 1970. After the commercial failure of their first album, Gates, Griffin and Royer, along with studio drummer Mike Botts, returned to the studio in a second attempt to make a hit record. Thanks largely to the success of the coinciding single "Make It With You / Why Do You Keep Me Waiting", the album was a success, peaking at 12 on Billboard 200.
