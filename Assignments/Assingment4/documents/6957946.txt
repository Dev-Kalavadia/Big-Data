Since 1999, the spider has been the subject of an email hoax claiming that it was a fatal spider found lurking under toilet seats in North Florida. This hoax was a rehashing of an older email circulated in 1999 with similar claims, except under the name "South American Blush Spider (arachnius gluteus)" - literally "butt spider". Similar email hoaxes (with details of the original changed) occurred in other parts of the world, alleging the same falsity in the recipients' countries. Lately it has also appeared on Facebook, also including a picture of the arachnid. Posts commonly report of it being found world-round, suggesting everyone must take precautions. No such events appear to have occurred, and the story is considered an urban legend.Snopes: Urban Legends Reference Pages: Two-Striped Telamonia Spider. Retrieved 2007-FEB-25. The false rumor has since spread to websites such as Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr in 2012. Now the same hoax is circulating on Whatsapp (2018).
The hoax has also been seen on facebook in 2019.
