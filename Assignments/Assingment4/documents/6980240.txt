Title: Pennsylvania Route 662

Pennsylvania Route 662 (PA 662) is a  state highway located in Berks County in eastern Pennsylvania. Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 422 (US 422) in Douglassville and its northern terminus is at PA 61 in Shoemakersville. The route is a two-lane undivided road its entire length and passes through rural areas. PA 662 heads north from Douglassville, intersecting PA 562 in Yellow House before becoming concurrent with PA 73 northwest through Oley. From here, PA 662 continues north and meets PA 12 in Pricetown before passing through the borough of Fleetwood and coming to a junction with US 222 in Moselem Springs. After this, the route continues west and intersects PA 143 before reaching its terminus at PA 61.

Between 1859 and 1897, the portion of road between Douglassville and Yellow House was a turnpike known as the Douglassville and Yellow House Turnpike. PA 662 was first designated by 1930 between US 422 in Douglassville and PA 562 in Amityville. In the 1930s, the route was extended north to US 122 (now PA 61) in Shoemakersville, replacing a part of PA 562 between Amityville and Yellow House. By 1966, PA 662 was realigned to its current alignment concurrent with PA 73 through Oley.

PA 662 begins at an intersection with US 422 in the community of Douglassville in Amity Township, Berks County. The road heads to the north on two-lane undivided Old Swede Road, passing residential neighborhoods in the community of Amity Gardens to the west and industrial development to the east. The route passes more homes as it turns northwest and passes through the community of Amityville. Past Amityville, PA 662 enters more agricultural surroundings with a few residences. In Yellow House, the road crosses PA 562 and enters Oley Township, where the name of the road becomes Memorial Highway. The route heads north-northwest through farmland in the Oley Valley region before reaching a roundabout with PA 73 in the community of Oley. At this point, PA 662 forms a concurrency with PA 73 by turning northwest onto that road, with the name remaining Memorial Highway. The two routes pass a few businesses in Oley, bypassing the residential center of the community to the southwest, before heading into areas of farms and woods.

==History==

The section of PA 662 between Douglassville and Yellow House was originally known as the King's Highway. In 1859, this road became a turnpike known as the Douglassville and Yellow House Turnpike, which existed until 1897. When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, present-day PA 662 was not legislated as part of a route. By 1928, what would become PA 662 was paved between Douglassville and Yellow House, in the Oley area, and between Pricetown and Moselem Springs. PA 662 was first designated by 1930 to run from US 422 in Douglassville north to PA 562 in Amityville, while PA 562 was designated along the portion of road between Amityville and Yellow House. In the 1930s, PA 662 was extended north from Amityville to US 122 (now PA 61) in Shoemakersville. The route replaced the PA 562 designation between Amityville and Yellow House. At this time, the entire length of PA 662 was paved. By 1966, PA 662 was rerouted to its current alignment through Oley along with PA 73, having previously passed through the community along Deturk Road, Friedensburg Road, and Main Street. 

A roundabout was constructed at the intersection with US 222 in Richmond Township in order to reduce traffic congestion. The project, which cost $6.6 million, replaced the signalized intersection between the two routes with a roundabout, with US 222 widened to four lanes at the roundabout. Construction of the roundabout began on September 6, 2016. The roundabout opened to traffic on May 22, 2018, with all lanes at the roundabout opened on July 20, 2018. On March 29, 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced plans to construct roundabouts at both intersections between PA 73 and PA 662 in Oley Township. Construction of the roundabouts, which cost $5.7 million, began in April 2019. The roundabout at PA 73 and PA 662 on the eastern end of Oley opened on August 19, 2019 while the roundabout at PA 73 and PA 662 on the western end of Oley opened in November 2019.
