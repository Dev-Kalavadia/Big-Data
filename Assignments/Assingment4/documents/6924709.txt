Title: Mayo River (Dan River tributary)


The Mayo River is a tributary of the Dan River, which in turn is a tributary of the Roanoke River.  All three rivers flow through the U.S. states of Virginia and North Carolina. It is named for Major William Mayo (ca. 1685-1744).

==Course==
The Mayo River is formed by two main branches, the North Fork Mayo River and the South Fork Mayo River.  Both forks rise in Patrick County, Virginia, gathering the waters of many tributary streams.  The two forks join in northwestern Rockingham County, North Carolina, forming the Mayo River proper, which then flows south into joining the Dan River near the towns of Mayodan, North Carolina and Madison, North Carolina.
