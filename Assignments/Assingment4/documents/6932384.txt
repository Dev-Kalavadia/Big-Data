Title: Cevio


Cevio is the capital of the district of Vallemaggia in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. In 2006 Cevio grew by incorporating the villages of Bignasco and Cavergno, previously municipalities in their own right.

==History==
Cevio was first mentioned in 1335 as Zevio.

The municipality has long been the principal town of the district. In 1858, the municipality of Linescio was separated from it.
Chancellor Giovan Angelo Franzoni, who was in power for 36 years, built himself a Patrician palazzo outside the center of Cevio.

After the Second World War a rapid diversification of the historical heritage began. In 1962, the Museo di Valmaggia was founded to preserve and show the material heritage of the valley. After acquisition and restoration of the Palazzo Franzoni, the first regional ethnographic museum of the canton of Ticino was opened in 1963 there.

In the fall of 2006, Cavergno and Bignasco were incorporated into the municipality; Bignasco failed to resist the incorporation in court.
