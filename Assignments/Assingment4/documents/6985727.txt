Title: List of California 14,000-foot summits



This is a complete list of the 12 summits with elevation higher than  in the U.S. state of California, with at least   of topographic prominence. In mountaineering parlance, these peaks are known as fourteeners. The main fourteener article has a list of all of the fourteeners in the United States, as well as references, more information about how the list is determined, and caveats about accuracy.

The summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The topographic elevation of a summit measures the height of the summit above a geodetic sea level.
#The topographic prominence of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.
#The topographic isolation (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.The topographic isolation of a summit is the great-circle distance to its nearest point of equal elevation.
