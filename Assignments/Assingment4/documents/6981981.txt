==Music video==

The music video was created in computer graphics by Semiconductor's Joe Gerhardt and Ruth Jarman. It follows the view of a flock of birds, and presents a lighthouse, presumably very similar to the house in which they stayed. Brad Osborn has noted how the craggy, icy peaks depicted in the video are linked to the pentatonic leaps in the lead vocal melody, and also to the cold, metallic timbres used in the recording.
