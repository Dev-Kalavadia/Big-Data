== Plot ==

Day on Fire tells the story of a singer, a model, an Arab woman journalist, and a physician as they criss-cross New York City over a 12-hour period. Their intersecting lives unfold against the backdrop of a ghastly suicide bombing in Israel, and the strange New York City wanderings of a malevolent Handsome Man, whose predatory intents lend an air of inevitable, horrific violence. Beautifully and hauntingly musical, this thriller also has a political and personal intrigue that mounts inexorably as the sun begins to set on this fateful day. By the time night has fallen in the city, the crossing of these individual fates is sealed. Each of these four women has found their destiny amidst the brutality that the film reveals.
