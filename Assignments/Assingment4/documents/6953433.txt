==Fitch house==
The Fitch house was partially burned during the "burning of Norwalk" raid carried out by William Tryon and British troops in July 1779 and only one wing of the house was left standing.  Fitch descendants lived in the rebuilt house until 1945. In 1956 the Fitch house was relocated to make way for the construction of the Connecticut Turnpike.  It stands today as part of the Mill Hill Historic Park in Norwalk next to the Green.

== Legacy ==
Fitch Street in East Norwalk is named in honor of the Fitch family including: Thomas Fitch I (1612–1704), a town founder; Thomas IV, the governor; and Thomas Fitch V, soldier and patriot.

His son, Colonel Thomas Fitch, V (1725–1795), served with British colonial troops in the French and Indian Wars; primarily in upstate New York, near Fort Crailo.  After that conflict Thomas, V returned to Norwalk and was a prominent resident during and after the American Revolution.  He served as a town councilman and helped with the reconstruction efforts after the burning of Norwalk in 1779.

The former Thomas Fitch school along Strawberry Hill Avenue in Norwalk was named in his honor, as well as to honor the other Thomas Fitches who contributed to the town.

The unincorporated settlement of Fitchville, located in the Firelands area of the historic Connecticut Western Reserve in the State of Ohio, is named for the governor and his family.
