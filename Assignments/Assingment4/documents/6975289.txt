Title: Marco Minnemann




Marco Minnemann (born 24 December 1970) is a German multi-instrumentalist and composer who primarily plays drums.

==Career==
Minnemann has released over a dozen solo albums as drummer, multi-instrumentalist, and vocalist, and performed on over 100 studio albums with dozens of artists and groups. He has previously been a member of the German funk-metal crossover band Freaky Fukin Weirdoz and has performed and recorded with German rock band H-Blockx and Grammy-nominated English musician Steven Wilson. He is the drummer for the Mute Gods, a trio led by Nick Beggs of British new wave band Kajagoogoo, and he has performed with Joe Satriani since 2013. Minnemann appeared on the cover of the June 2007 issue of Modern Drummer, with the magazine writing that "he has been instrumental in developing the advanced concept of complex interdependence", a drum technique allowing him to play varying patterns with each of his feet and hands.

In 2006, Minnemann recorded a 51-minute live drum solo that served as the basis for his Normalizer 2 project, in which he shared the track with several musicians and asked that they each write and record their own work accompanying the composition. A number of the resulting recordings were released as duo albums, including Trey Gunn's Modulator, Alex Machacek's 24 Tales, and Mike Keneally's Evidence of Humanity.

In late 2017, Minnemann joined international prog-rock rock supergroup the Sea Within and appears on their 2018 debut. Formed by Swedish guitarist and singer-songwriter Roine Stolt, the band also features bassist Jonas Reingold, guitarist Daniel Gildenlöw, and keyboardist Tom Brislin.

Minnemann is a member of instrumental rock power trio the Aristocrats, playing alongside Guthrie Govan and Bryan Beller. In 2019, the group released their fourth studio album, You know what...?

In 2020, Minnemann and collaborator Randy McStine formed McStine & Minnemann. The duo released two albums that year: the self-titled McStine & Minnemann and McStine & Minnemann II.

Minnemann was featured as a voice actor in the second season of the Titmouse-animated series Metalocalypse. The episode, which also featured Mike Patton of Faith No More, aired on Adult Swim in 2008.
