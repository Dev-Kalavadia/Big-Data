Title: 1991 South American Women's Football Championship

It was the first staging of the South American Women's Football Championship and determined the CONMEBOL's single qualifier for the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Brazil won the tournament, that was played with only three teams: Brazil, Chile and Venezuela. Adriana was the tournament's top scorer, with four goals. Chile's Ada Cruz was elected as the best player.
