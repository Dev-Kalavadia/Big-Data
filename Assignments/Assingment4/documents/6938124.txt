==Club career==

Nicknamed La Gata (The Cat), Fernández began his professional career with River Plate. After a stint with Racing and another season back with River, in 2006 he was loaned to Monterrey. When the contract was finished, Monterrey declined to pay the nearly two million dollars to permanently buy Gastón, thus prompting him to return to River Plate in December 2006.

However, Daniel Passarella, then River's head coach, believed the team had enough strikers. Fernández was therefore sold to San Lorenzo de Almagro. In San Lorenzo La Gata revindictated his career. He was the leading scorer of the team that won the 2007 Clausura championship. He then spent one year in Mexico with Tigres de la UANL.

In 2008, Fernández returned to Argentina to play for Estudiantes de La Plata, where he finished as runner up with the team in the 2008 Copa Sudamericana. He was then a first team regular in the team that won the 2009 Copa Libertadores, where he scored the equalising goal in the second leg of the final against Cruzeiro. Subsequently, he went back to Tigres, where he helped win the 2009 SuperLiga title against Chicago Fire. In January 2010, Tigres released the Argentine winger upon his request, and Fernández returned to Estudiantes.Fernández leaves Tigres Upon his return, Fernández helped lead Estudiantes to the 2010 Apertura tournament title.
