==Causes==
The Bosnian diaspora was the consequence of either voluntary departure, coercion and/or forced migrations or expulsions that occurred on several occasions since the 1870s:
* In the late 19th century to the east and west caused by the invading forces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
* The Bosnian War in the early 1990s (from 1992 to 1995). Many Bosnian refugees sought asylum in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
