Title: Transit (Sponge Cola album)


Transit is the second studio album by the Pinoy rock band Sponge Cola, released on September 8, 2006, and their first under Universal Records. The album was certified Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) with sales of 40,000 physical CD copies to date.

Transit spawned a carrier single, "Bitiw", which was released to radio stations on August 23. In 2008, Transit was re-released as Transit Deluxe, which features additional songs, acoustic versions of songs, a cover song by APO Hiking Society, and a radio edit version, as well as a Video CD (VCD) containing music videos.

In late 2013, Transit Deluxe was re-issued as part of Palabas & Transit Collection, a release that also includes the standard edition of Sponge Cola's debut album Palabas; this release does not include a VCD.

==Background==
In an interview, Yael Yuzon explained, "I think on the first record we just wanted to have an album out as a collection of songs written from high school; while on Transit, we wanted to push the limits of our song-writing so we took a creatively different approach for every song."

==In popular culture==
The single "Bitiw" was used as a theme song for the television series Pedro Penduko. It was also performed in the second season of Your Face Sounds Familiar, when Yael Yuzon dueted with KZ Tandingan, the latter of whom impersonated Yael.
