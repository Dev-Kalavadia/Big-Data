Russian investigators claim that Bouralha travelled from London to Chechnya in 2001. Former associates of the Scotland Yard in London confirmed that Bouralha had lived in London and had been a frequent visitor at Finsbury Park mosque in 2000. He was reportedly detained in September 2004 in Chechnya as he attempted to flee to Azerbaijan to treat a bullet wound in his chest.
