Title: Moleno


Moleno is a former municipality in the district of Bellinzona in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

On 2 April 2017 the former municipalities of Camorino, Claro, Giubiasco, Gnosca, Gorduno, Gudo, Monte Carasso, Pianezzo, Preonzo, Sant'Antonio and Sementina merged into the municipality of Bellinzona.

==History==
Moleno is first mentioned in 1213, though this comes from a copy from 1588. In 1256 it was mentioned as a Rivo de Moline. During the Middle Ages, the water running from the Moleno valley formed the southern boundary of the Levantine valley. In 1335, it became part of the County of Bellinzona. In 1396, its territory was combined with Preonzo, to form a single village community. In 1403–22 it was part of the Uri and Obwalden dominated Levantine district. This situation lasted until Bellinzona moved against the Confederates.  During these years, the confederation officers recognized, the rights and customary law of Moleno and Preonzo.

The parish church of S. Vittore was built in the 13th Century. In the 15th Century it was rebuilt and in 1542, it broke away from the church at Biasca.  Moleno, Gnosca and Preonzo were the three municipalities in the district of Bellinzona where the Ambrosian Rite was followed in the churches.

In the past, the economy was dominated by farming and alpine herding. However, in 2000, two thirds of the workforce commuted (especially to Biasca and Bellinzona).
