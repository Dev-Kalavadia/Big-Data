Title: Freshwater Bay (Western Australia)

Freshwater Bay is a bay of the Swan River, in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia.  It is about 5Â km upstream from the mouth of the river at Fremantle and is overlooked by the suburbs of Dalkeith, Claremont, Mosman Park and Peppermint Grove. Freshwater Bay was named after Freshwater Bay and Freshwater, Isle of Wight by Henry Charles Prinsep (1844-1922), who had a riverside family holiday cottage there, The Chine.

==Indigenous context==
Before and after the arrival of Europeans, the bay had significance to local indigenous people.Faulkner, Kerry.
(2000) "Freshwater Bay...I remember it well." (Nyungar elder Bropho talks about his memories of the Bay from his youth and his native title claim over crown land on the Peppermint Grove foreshore). Subiaco post, 26 Aug. 2000, p.1, 63

== Features ==
Much of the bay's foreshore on the western and eastern sides are limestone cliffs. The head of the bay is the location of the Claremont foreshore.
Other important features to the south are the sand spit at Point Walter and Point Resolution at the eastern end.

== Human interaction ==
Parts of Freshwater Bay are designated ski areas. Due to Point Walter's spit and the high surrounding limestone cliffs, the bay has relatively calm waters and is protected from winds, making the area suited for jet skiing, rowing, sailing and other water recreations.
