===1995 uncontracted and concession player selections===
As part of Fremantle Football Club's impending entry to the AFL in the 1995 AFL season, clubs that lost uncontracted players to the new side were allocated a 16-year-old concession selection to compensate them for their loss.  These players were otherwise not eligible to be drafted until the following draft.  Fremantle and Essendon Football Club arranged a deal where they would not recruit any uncontracted players from clubs below Essendon on the ladder, to allow Essendon the chance to have the first selection in the concession selections, which they used to recruit their future captain and leading goalscorer, Matthew Lloyd.
