Title: Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane

The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane is the Ordinary of the Scottish Episcopal Diocese of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane. The see is located at St Ninian's Cathedral in Perth, Scotland.Crockford's Clerical Directory, 100th edition, (2007), Church House Publishing. .

Following the Glorious Revolution, the Church of Scotland abolished the Episcopacy in 1689 and adopted a Presbyterian government. The Episcopalian remnant slowly formed the independent Scottish Episcopal Church. In the 19th century, the three dioceses were gradually merged to become the present Diocese of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane. The see is currently vacant; an electoral synod convened to elect the next bishop on 2 June 2018, electing Ian Paton. The previous bishop of the united diocese was the Right Reverend David Chillingworth.
