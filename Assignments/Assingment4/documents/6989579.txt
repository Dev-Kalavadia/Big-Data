Title: Messin'



Messin' is a rock album released in 1973 by Manfred Mann's Earth Band.

Messin' followed Glorified Magnified and preceded Solar Fire, and like all Earth Band albums contains a mixture of originals and covers (see track listing below).

"Buddah" also appeared on the Vertigo budget sampler double album Suck It and See, along with tracks by then-labelmates Kraftwerk, Jade Warrior and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, amongst others.

The album was produced by Manfred Mann and engineered by John Edwards at Maximum Sound Studios, London in 1973.

For the United States release, the album was re-titled Get Your Rocks Off and the track "Pretty Good" was included in place of "Black and Blue", seemingly because the latter was about slavery and deemed unsuitable for the US market.Robert M Corich, Sleeve notes, Messin' album, 1998 Both tracks were included on the 1998 re-mastered re-issue. Under this title, the album just barely made the US Billboard 200, spending only two weeks on the charts and peaking at number 196 on June 30, 1973.
