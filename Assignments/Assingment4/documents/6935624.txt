The Conejo Valley Unified School District was established in 1974 from the merger of three school districts covering the Conejo Valley, including two elementary districts and the eastern portion of the Oxnard Union High School District (OUHSD). Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park high schools predate unification, having been built by OUHSD in the 1960s.
