===Agra===

The hamlet of Bigogno, which is part of Agra, is first mentioned in 1270 in an inventory of the lands of the monastery of S. Abbondio in Como in the Valle di Lugano.  The inventory of Como Cathedral (1298) mentions their allodial titles and episcopal loans in Agra as well as possessions of the Disentis Abbey.  The same document also mentions the church of S. Tommaso in Agra.  The church initially belonged to the parish of S. Pietro in Pambio and then became an under-parish in 1591.  The Chapel of S. Assunta in Bigogno was completed before 1609.  In the statutes of Como from 1335, the Concilium or Vicinanza of Agra and Premona or Barbengo is first mentioned.

In addition to agriculture, the village was once famous for training and sending artisans to Russia along with other European nations.  In 1912 a regional sanatorium opened in the village.  It was a residence to for many, especially German-speaking, notables and intellectuals.  They published the monthly magazine Die Terrasse (The Terrace) from the sanatorium.  It was closed in 1969 and fell into disrepair.

===Gentilino===

In the Early Middle Ages Gentilino belonged to the royal court of Agnuzzo, which was donated in 818 by Emperor Louis the Pious to the clergy of Como.  During the 11th century it belonged to the monastery of S. Abbondio in Como.  The union of the monastic estates in 1335 probably led to the creation of the Concilium Sancti Abundii which included Gentilino and Viglio as well as Montagnola and the surrounding villages.  In the early 18th century, the village wanted to buy the monastery's rights to the village.  However, this triggered a long-running dispute, in which the Canton was eventually involved.

It is believed that the church of S. Abbondio was the center of a medieval parish, which became a sub-parish in the 11th century.  However, the first written record of the church dates from 1140.  The current appearance is due to an enlargement in the 17th century.

In the past centuries, the population lived mainly from agriculture, but there were also a large exodus of builders (known as Maestranze).  Recently, it has grown into a bedroom community for the nearby city of Lugano.

===Montagnola===

The merger of several formerly separate properties of the monastery of S. Abbondio in Como in 1535, led to the establishment of the Concilium Sancti Abundii which covered not only Gentilino but the village of Montagnola with the hamlets of Vigilio, Orino, Arasio, Certenago, Poprino, Barca and Scairolo.  An inventory of the monastery mentioned the presence of a fortress at Arasio.

Montagnola belongs to the parish of S. Abbondio at Gentilino.  The chapels in S. Silvestro in Arasio and SS Nazaro in Celso were first mentioned in 1270 and 1442 respectively.

The local economy was based on agriculture as well as emigration of architects and builders from the Gilardi, Lucchini, Berra and Camuzzi families into various European countries, especially Russia.  Several of these builders were able to create major works in these foreign cities and rise to great fame.  The pleasant climate and attractive location of the village attracted many illustrious personalities from abroad, including the writer Hermann Hesse.  A museum to the writer opened in 1997.  Between 1923 and 1927 it was the seat of the prestigious Officina Bodoni, the printing shop of Hans (later Giovanni) Mardersteig.  Since 1956, Montagnola is home to an international school, The American School In Switzerland. Due to its proximity to Lugano, Montagnola is now a kind of residential suburb of the city.

===Carabietta===
Carabietta is first mentioned in 1335 as Carabio.  In 1375 it was mentioned as La Carabieta.

At the end of the 14th century it belonged to the Pieve of Agno, and in the 15th and 16th centuries to the Pieve of Lugano.  It eventually became a dependent of the parish church of Morcote.  Between 1803 and 1816, Carabietta belonged to the political municipality of Morcote.  During the Middle Ages (documented first in 1355) and under the Swiss Confederation (reconfirmed in 1664 and 1784), the village was granted the status as an imperial cassina or a village that was exempt from taxes.

The church of San Bernardo was built in 1634, and stands on the foundations of a late-medieval church.

The residents of the village supplemented their income from agriculture through money sent back by emigrants.

Carabietta was one of the smallest municipalities of Ticino.  It was developing gradually into a small commuter town.
