Title: When Your Heart Stops Beating (song)

"When Your Heart Stops Beating" is a song by American rock band +44, released on November 14, 2006 as the third single from the group's debut studio album, When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006). "When Your Heart Stops Beating" was released to radio on October 3, 2006. The song was the only single from the album to chart, peaking at number 14 on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

==Background==
The title track, "When Your Heart Stops Beating", features "snotty, mid-range British-sounding Telecasters" and was inspired by the story of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen — "you love your lady and outside of that, fuck everything else," according to Hoppus. Barker built the song around the driving bass drum beat: "I kind of approached it like a rock steady or like an old like four on the floor ska song, but played more like a rock drummer, like if a rock drummer was accidentally playing that stuff [...] It was kind of new wave and I felt like it needed a driving four on the floor." The track's percussion has been compared to that of Police drummer Stewart Copeland.

==Music video==
The music video for "When Your Heart Stops Beating" was shot on September 9, 2006 in Los Angeles and directed by Liz Friedlander and Sheli Jury. +44 put out an open casting call for the group's fans to appear in the video. The video is a "pretty stock shoot of a group playing in an abandoned warehouse whilst all around people dance and couples are seen arguing."Shooman, 2010. p. 158

The band embarked on a promotional tour of the United Kingdom in late 2006; Barker was in constant pain but soldiered through the performances, altering his kit set-up to accommodate. "He is now using his left foot as his right arm, Def Leppard style," confirmed Hoppus. A doctor informed Barker he had broken a bone in his arm during the band's video shoot and was instructed to immediately rest and not take part in the band's upcoming live dates, including early 2007 jaunts to Australia and Europe. Barker nevertheless took part, but after an excruciating Amsterdam gig, the band drafted Gil Sharone, then of The Dillinger Escape Plan, to fill-in for him.Shooman, 2010. p. 163
