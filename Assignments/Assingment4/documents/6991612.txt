Title: Ovarense Basquetebol


Ovarense Basquetebol is a professional basketball team that plays in Ovar, Portugal. The team plays in the LPB. The Ovarense created its section of basketball in 1970, with the initiative of a member entrepreneur, João Gonçalves, but in this period of time managed to assert itself as one of the standards and the inevitable reference method in Portugal.

==History==
Between 1976–77 and 1978–79, Ovarense ascended from third to first, on the national level, indicating that the team's basketball vocation was strong. The club never fell from its division, and the arrival of two Americans at the end of the 80s gave the team the quality required to raise its level.
