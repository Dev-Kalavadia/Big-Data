==History==
The township of Newham was occupied as a station in 1847 by settlers named Peters and Dryden and called Dryden's Rock; The district of Newham and Woodend was created in December 1861; it became the Shire of Newham and Woodend in January 1905.Blake, Les (1977). Place Names of Victoria, p. 201. Melbourne: Rigby Limited. 

Newham Post Office opened on 16 September 1861 and closed in 1971.

===Possible origins of the name===
In 1848 it may have been named Newham after Rev. Newham, an Anglican priest. Around the 1850s, Newham was known variously as Hieland Town or Isle of Skye, perhaps indicating a Scottish heritage of the early settlers. It would appear that these names were colloquial terms rather than official names.

While it is likely that the town was named after Rev. Newham, other theories exist regarding the origins of the name Newham. Historians appear to be divided on the origins of Edward Dryden, one of the first settlers, who is thought by some to have been born in Newham, Northumberland, England. Alternatively, it has been supposed that Dryden came from Oldham, Greater Manchester, England, and that he named his new home in recognition of the new country.

Newham has a primary school (State School 1913), a hall (1903) and a park. There is a small, unused bluestone church (1868) opposite the school. The Newham Fire Brigade station is on the corner of Dons Road and Rochford Road (opposite the General store).

On 4 December 2009, the modernisations to the 1905 Mechanics' Hall were officially opened.
