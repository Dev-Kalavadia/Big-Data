Title: Jagakarsa

Jagakarsa is a district of South Jakarta, one of the administrative cities in Jakarta Indonesia. Jagakarsa is the southernmost district of South Jakarta (the southernmost district of Jakarta belongs to Ciracas District in East Jakarta.) Jagakarsa District is bounded by Ciliwung River to the east, Krukut River to the west, and Margasatwa-Sagu-Joe-T.B.Simatupang-Poltangan Road to the north, while the boundary marches with Depok city to the south.

As one of the southernmost districts of Jakarta, Jagakarsa has a relatively higher elevation (average 52-meter above sea level) and a cooler climate than the rest of Jakarta (average 25–27-degree Celsius). Jagakarsa has been allotted for water reservoir use, resulting in low footprint for buildings in Jagakarsa and high amount of green area.Rencana Umum Tata Ruang (RUTR) dan Rencana Bagian Wilayah Kota (RBWK) Tahun 1985–2005 

==History==


The oldest part of Jagakarsa formed part of the particuliere land or private domain of Tandjong West. Its first recorded owner was Jan Andries Duurkoop, who bought the estate from an unknown prior owner between 1760 and 1780. Duurkoop utilized the estate as grazing land where he kept about five thousand cattle heads, producing milk and meat for the growing urban settlement of Batavia (now Jakarta). Duurkoop died in 1792; and his widow, Johanna Adriana Christina Duurkoop, remarried to Conraag Johnas, then moved to Japan for the latter's military career. The couple later returned to Batavia, where Conraag Johnas died in 1803. The estate of Tandjong West was inherited by descendants of Johanna Adriana Christina Duurkoop in 1838.

By the early twentieth century, the estate of Tandjong West was owned by a company, N. V. Landbouw Maatschappij Tandjong West, headed by the prominent landlord ('landheer') Tan Liok Tiauw, of the late colonial period.

==Cultural significance==
