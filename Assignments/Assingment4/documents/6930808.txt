Title: Louis Tsatoumas




Louis Tsatoumas (, born 12 February 1982) is a Greek long jumper.

==Biography==
He won his first major senior medal in 2007 at the European Indoor Athletics Championships, where he claimed the silver medal behind an Italian record-breaking Andrew Howe. On 2 June 2007 in Kalamata Tsatoumas jumped 8.66 metres, achieving a personal best and a Greek record for the event. The performance was the best in the world since Iván Pedroso leaped 8.70 m to win the gold medal at the 1995 World Championships. Tsatoumas ranks as the eighth best long jumper in history and holds the European record in the event at low altitude.

At the 2008 Olympics he had the longest qualifying jump with 8.27 m, but after three consecutive fouls in the final he finished in last place. He was the bronze medallist at both the 2009 Mediterranean Games and 2009 European Team Championships.Sampaolo, Diego (2009-07-04).
