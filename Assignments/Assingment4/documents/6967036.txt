Grancia is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Grancia is first mentioned in 1309 as in loco Grancie.  Until 1825 it was part of the municipality of Carabbia.

At the end of the 13th century, there was a religious institution in Grancia that was under the authority of the monastery of S. Maria in Torello (now part of Carona).  According to tradition, in the Middle Ages, Grancia had the largest granary in the region.  Most of the grain came from Brusimpiano and was ground in the mills along the Pian Scairolo river.

The church of S. Carpoforo was probably built on the foundations of an older church in the 16th century.  This church, along with S. Siro in Carabbia, belonged to the parish of S. Pietro in Pambio.  In 1608, the two parishes broke away from Pambio, and in 1670 Grancia split from S. Siro.

The village economy relied mostly on farming.  In the 19th century, a brick factory opened.  In the last decades of the 20th century, industrial areas grew around Grancia.  The industrial area and resulting development led to the construction of large shopping malls.  New housing developments, access to the A2 motorway and huge storage tanks affect the environment and landscape of the village.
