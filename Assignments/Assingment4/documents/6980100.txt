It was built in 1869 by Moses Barlow on the site of a former tavern, and is a -story, Second Empire style brick dwelling with a slate mansard roof. The house has several asymmetrically placed side and rear wings. It features a two-story six-hole (three up, three down) privy thought to be the only house with such a structure.  Access to the unique feature can be obtained from both levels of the house.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

The house was purchased by an anonymous donor in 1999 and presented as a gift to the Phelps Community Historical Society.  The house has been renovated and is now open to the public for tours.
