Title: Tweedles


Tweedles is a concept album by American art rock band The Residents. It was released on October 31, 2006. 
The CD is accompanied by a two-part book: the first half consists of the album's spoken lines, and the second half contains the lyrics of the songs.

It was recorded in 2006 when the Residents were invited by a friend in Romania to try out his new recording studios. As The Residents' own studio was undergoing maintenance to make it earthquake-resistant and could not be used for a year, they took the opportunity to record a new album.

==Concept==
Tweedles tells the story of an "emotional vampire" from a first person perspective.  He draws power from his well-developed ability to manipulate both men and women into seeing him as their perfect lover, at which point he uses that affection in order to secure sexual favors before moving onto his next victim, leaving confusion and pain in his wake while feeling nothing.  The character is shown contemplating his internal conflicts, lack of empathy, and romantic idealism, which he deems "disgusting".  Toward the end of the album it is revealed that Tweedles is the name of a clown alter-ego the narrator would have created if he had succeeded in becoming an entertainer.
