Title: Language Arts (album)



Language Arts is an album by Canadian alternative hip hop musician Buck 65, released in 1996 on the Four Ways To Rock/Metaphorensics labels (see 1996 in music) and reissued by Warner in 2002.

The album is considered the first in the (presently) seven-part Language Arts series, also taking in the Vertex, Man Overboard, Synesthesia, Square, and Talkin' Honky Blues albums, as well as 2006's Strong Arm mixtape made available online.

The record saw several pressings with different artwork. The original was released only on cassette with artwork by Thesis; later CD versions were designed by Hugh Morse with artwork by Nick Recka. Additionally, this record and the other two Language Arts records prior to Buck's signing to Warner Music were remastered, repackaged with new artwork, and re-released by Warner in 2002. There is also a two disc versions of this album that is close to 90 minutes long.
