==Future==

Heikintori has long been in need for renovation. Part of Heikintori belongs to the environment designed by Aarne Ervi, which falls under protection.Tuominen-Halomo, Anneli: Suomen toiseksi vanhin kauppakeskus rapistuu Espoossa – remontista ei tietoa vieläkään, Länsiväylä 13 March 2016. Accessed on 25 August 2016. The renovation was supposed to start in late 2019 and be completed in 2021. The plans included building four floors of apartments on top of Heikintori and dismantling Heikintori's current parking house and replacing it with a 7-floor residential house. The commercial spaces were supposed to be renovated honouring the spirit of Aarne Ervi and not be expanded. The third floor of Heikintori will probably house a kindergarten, and part of Heikintori's roof will act as the kindergarten's yard.Legendaarinen kauppakeskus Espoossa vihdoin täysremonttiin – katolle tulossa asuntoja, Länsiväylä 28 October 2017.

In 2020, Heikintori only had a few stores left, including two restaurants, a bar, a barber's shop and a flea market. The only surviving original store is restaurant Ribis.Moilanen, Kaisu: "Ei täällä oikein ole mitään, mitä tarvitsisin" – Tapiolassa rapistuu tyhjentynyt kauppakeskus, josta tuli omistajalleen ongelma, Helsingin Sanomat 8 October 2020.
