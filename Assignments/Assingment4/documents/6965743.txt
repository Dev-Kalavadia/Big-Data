In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, any Twenty20 matches played between Morocco and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 would have been full T20I, though prior to July 2019 Morocco had not participated in any T20I matches. Owing to violations against the ICC constitution, Morocco were expelled from the ICC in July 2019.
