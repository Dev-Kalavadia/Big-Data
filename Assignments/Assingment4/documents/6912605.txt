==History==
Wade Ceramics was established in 1867 in Burslem, England.Harrington, Ben. "Wade Whimsies Maker Put up for Sale". The Telegraph. 10 June 2012. It originally comprised several different companies founded by various members of the Wade family and was united as Wade Potteries Limited in 1958. The original companies were:

# Wade & Myatt (later became George Wade & Son, which made industrial ceramics and Wade Whimsies). Established 1867.
# John Wade & Co (later Wade Heath & Co, which made decorative ware, particularly Art Deco vases in the 1930s). Established 1867.
# J & W Wade (later AJ Wade Ltd, which made tiles, notably the original tiles for the London Underground). Established 1891.

In 1905, George Wade & Son took over rival company Henry Hallen. As the Hallen firm was owned by a distant relative and had been founded in 1810, Wade Ceramics (through this) claims to have been established in 1810. In the 1930s, Colonel Sir George Wade gained control of the Wade companies that had previously been run by his father and uncles. He also started further Wade factories, including Wade (Ulster) Ltd in Portadown.

Following the death of Sir George Wade in 1986 at the age of 94, and the death of leukaemia of his innovative son George Anthony (Tony) Wade in 1987, the Wade potteries were taken over by Beauford Plc in 1998 and renamed Wade Ceramics Ltd. In the early 1990s the Irish pottery factory was renamed Seagoe Ceramics, and was closed down.

Beauford plc's pottery factories were taken over by a management buyout in 1999, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Wade Allied Holdings Ltd. Edward Duke, former CEO of Beauford, became the major shareholder of Wade Allied Holdings and Chairman of Wade Ceramics. His partner Paul Farmer became Managing Director of Wade. In 2009, Wade Allied Holdings invested Â£7.9m in a new factory with the latest robotic manufacturing equipment to make ceramic flagons for the whisky industry. The last Wade factory in Burslem was closed in 2010, and sold for housing development. 
The original factory is still standing and has lay derelict for 10 years, subject to vandalism and arson over the years.

As of 2011, Wade's Ceramics operates from Bessemer Drive in Eturia, Stoke On Trent. In November 2022, The company entered into administration citing the difficult UK economic conditions and rising energy prices for its operating difficulties.
