The Old Mount Dora A. C. L. Railroad Station (also known as the Mount Dora Chamber of Commerce) is a historic Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) depot in Mount Dora, Florida. It is located at 341 North Alexander Street. It was built by ACL in 1915, replacing an earlier depot built in 1895 when the line was part of the Plant System. The station's design, which includes elements of the Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival styles, is similar to other ACL stations of the era. The line was mainly used to ship citrus fruit and other agricultural products, though its passenger trains also brought tourists to the city. Passenger service ended in 1949, and the Mount Dora Chamber of Commerce bought the station in 1981. On March 5, 1992, the station was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
