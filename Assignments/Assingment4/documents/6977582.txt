Title: Like Red on a Rose


Like Red on a Rose is the fourteenth studio album by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released on September 26, 2006. The album produced two singles, the title track and "A Woman's Love", which respectively reached numbers 15 and 5 on the Hot Country Songs charts.

This album was produced by singer Alison Krauss, who also selected the songs. "A Woman's Love", a re-recording of a song previously included on Jackson's 1998 High Mileage album, was the only song written by Jackson. This album abandoned Jackson's typical neotraditional country style and his usual producer Keith Stegall, and instead went for a soft rock/adult contemporary sound.
