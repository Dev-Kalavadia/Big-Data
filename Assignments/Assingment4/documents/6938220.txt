==History==

===Former schools===

Of the two antecedent schools that merged to establish the College, Monterey High School was established in 1966 and Monterey Technical School in 1967. The schools served a growing demand for secondary education in the suburbs of Frankston North, Carrum Downs and Seaford. During this time, an Australian Defence Force/Victorian Government housing estate was being expanded in Frankston North,History. The Pines Project.  a post-World War II Brotherhood of St Laurence farming settlement was being redeveloped in Carrum Downs,History. Brotherhood of St Laurence.  and new home construction was progressing in the suburb of Seaford.

In its foundation year, 1966, the original students of Monterey High School were housed in four portable classroom buildings located at the Monterey State School in Monterey Boulevard. The campus of the High School on Forest Drive was completed in late-1966, with its students moving in at the commencement of 1967. The Technical School operated out of portable buildings at the High School for a year while its own campus was being completed on Silvertop Street. The buildings at each school were constructed of mixed brick and breeze block and were connected via covered and uncovered pathways. Multi-purpose gymnasiums were constructed at each campus and basketball and tennis courts and football and soccer fields were laid on their respective grounds. A music centre was also constructed on the campus of the Technical School and continues to be used by the College today.

===Merger===

By the early-1990s, attendance at technical schools in the state of Victoria had declined dramatically as students began to strive for academic achievement rather than for learning a trade.Edwards, Daniel (2007). "The vocational fate of government secondary schools". People and Place, vol. 15, no. 2 (Centre for Population and Urban Research). Melbourne: Monash University. pp 1–11. ISSN: 1039–4788 Due to this decline, and to reduce administrative costs, the Department of Education decided to merge the High School and Technical School.

Following a series of consultative parent-teacher meetings, the process of merging the schools was announced to take place between 1993 and 1995. College records state that the main concern voiced by both parents and teachers was that the merger may "incite violence" between the traditionally competitive High School and Technical School students. Some "tension" was reported between students during the merger years of the College, however, a reputation for "unruliness" was short-lived.

The new name of "Monterey Secondary College" was adopted in 1993 and was officially used from 1994. The former Technical School became the main campus (years 7–10) of the College in 1994, while the former High School was retained as a campus for senior students (years 11–12) completing the Victorian Certificate of Education during the merger years. The latter was eventually closed at the end of 1995 and has since been redeveloped into the Monterey Community Park—with a cycling and walking trail, playground, skate park and sports pitches now in place.Monterey Community Park.

===Recent history===

In 1997, a petition was presented to the Legislative Assembly of Victoria signed by 1,879 residents of Carrum Downs which sought action for the "construction of suitable facilities in Carrum Downs with the view of relocating Monterey Secondary College from its present location in Frankston North".Victorian Legislative Assembly: Votes and Proceedings, No.s. 59, 60, 61. Government of Victoria: Parliament of Victoria The petition was unsuccessful. During the 2000s, the public Carrum Downs Secondary College and a campus of the independent Flinders Christian Community College were eventually established in Carrum Downs to ease enrolments at Monterey Secondary College.

In the 1990s, a new multi-purpose gymnasium was constructed with the former gymnasium then redeveloped into a dance and drama centre. Its existing art studios, science labs, technology workshops and theatrette rooms were also upgraded and a hobby farm was added to the grounds. In the 2000s, eight new computer labs were added and its canteen was upgraded. During these decades, the College established its reputation for innovation and success in performing and visual arts. 

In the 2010s, a new A$2 million science centre was constructed and all its existing classroom wings were modernised in a A$4 million refurbishment.Monterey Secondary College.

Controversy ensued in 1996 when Nine Network broadcast the production of St. Columba's College, based on the 1990s television series The X-Files, instead of the winning production of Monterey Secondary College. It won the 2000 Victorian Premier Division competition with an original production based on the life of the Siberian Ice Maiden. It also produced productions based on the 1960s television series The Thunderbirds and the rise of the Roman Empire before the cancellation of the Challenge in 2010.
