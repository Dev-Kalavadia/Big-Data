Title: Jaffna Hindu College
Jaffna Hindu College (; ; abbreviated as JHC) is a national school in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. It was founded in 1886 by a group of Hindu people who wanted an English language alternative to the Christian missionary schools.

==History==
In the late 19th century all the English language schools in the area were run by Christian missionaries. In 1886, Williams Nevins Muthukumaru Sithamparapillai founded The Native Town High School. The school encountered financial problems and in 1889 it was taken over by S. Nagalingam, who re-located it to Vananarponnai. The school was renamed Nagalingam Town High School. In 1890, the school was handed over to the Jaffna Saiva (Samaya) Paripalana Sabhai. The school was moved to its present site and renamed The Hindu High School.

==Big Match==
