==Plot==
Living It Up was a TV version of the BBC radio comedy Band Waggon, and a film had also been made starring impresario Jack Hylton. In Living It Up Arthur Askey and Stinker were living in a flat on top of the A-R's Television House in Aldwych. Askey's daughter appeared as herself, as she had done in Love and Kisses in 1955. The characters would often speak directly to the studio audience, and Leila Williams, who would later become Blue Peter's first female presenter, made a guest appearance, as did Valentine Dyall.
