==Work==
He has written and published extensively on cerebral aneurysms, cerebrovascular arterial dissections, and collagen vascular disease as related to the central nervous system. Schievink is also an expert and well published author on Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak Syndrome. Schievink was the lead physician on the first ever successful attempt of using fibrin glue to reverse a coma."Neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center injected a biosynthetic "glue" to seal off a spinal fluid leak and restore a comatose patient to consciousness. An article describing the case appears in the April 21 issue of the British medical journal, The Lancet. It is the first known report of a situation in which a patient's coma was reversed by the injection of glue, according to Wouter I. Schievink, M.D., Director of the Neurovascular Surgery Program at Cedars-Sinai and the article's lead author." http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/72338.php
