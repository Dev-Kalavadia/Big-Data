Title: Wisdom of the Gnomes

Wisdom of the Gnomes (, literally "Call of the gnomes") is an animated series produced by Spanish company BRB Internacional and Televisión Española about Gnomes. It was a spin-off of the series The World of David the Gnome. It was based on the books The Secret Book of Gnomes by Wil Huygen.

Other sequels, both in serial and movie form, were The Great Adventure of the Gnomes (1995), The Gnomes in the Snow (1999) and The Fantastic Adventures of the Gnomes (2000).

== Plot ==
In this series the protagonist is a gnome called Klaus, a judge (aka "wise man Klaus"), who travels with his assistant Danny on Henry the Swan, trying to solve disputes and lawsuits between animals peacefully and wisely.

Like in The World of David the Gnome, the trolls also appear in this series. David himself appears in one episode.

The penultimate episode features Wil Huygen and his wife, the only pair of humans in direct communication with Gnomes. Klaus and Danny complain to Huygen of "inaccuracies" in his book, though what these errors are is not made specific.
