Title: Inquilaab (album)



Inquilaab (Urdu: انقلاب, literal English translation: "revolution") is the third studio album and the fourth overall album of the Pakistani band Junoon. Although previous albums by Junoon also achieved considerable success, 'Inquilaab' contained the band's first major hit, the patriotic song "Jazba-e-Junoon". The album also contained the hit "Saeein," which marked Junoon's foray into what later became the sufi rock sound that Junoon is most popularly associated with. Other hits from the album were "Mera Mahi" and "Husan Walo".

==Background==
Inquilaab was the first hit album by the Pakistani rock band Junoon, released in 1996. It was also the album which marked the beginning of a new genre of Pakistani music that Junoon pioneered - sufi rock, which later on became the genre that Junoon is widely recognized by. The track "Saeein" on the album is Junoon's venture into sufi rock.

The album's only single, "Jazba-e-Junoon" was a huge success all over the country and was the band's first big hit. The single topped through the music charts and began Junoon's dominance in the Pakistani music industry.

It was the first album in which Junoon developed a nationwide fan following, blending rock guitars and bluesy vocals with eastern elements like the use of tablas (traditional south Asian hand drums), raga-inspired melodies, traditional Pakistani folk music, and Eastern inspired poetry.
