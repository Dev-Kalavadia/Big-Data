In July 1916, Pybus reported an attempt at allogenic transplantation of pancreatic tissue. Despite a mild reduction in glucose excretion in one of two diabetic patients transplanted with fragments of human cadaveric pancreatic tissue.,*  both patients subsequently died.Schlich, T. (2010) Volume 18 of Rochester Studies in Medical History: The Origins of Organ Transplantation: Surgery and Laboratory Science, 1880-1930 p.74. University Rochester Press. . Retrieved August 2011

Pybus concluded that:...although transplants represented the most rational form of therapy, they would continue to fail as long as science did not understand the principles involved.

He presented his collection of books on the history of medicine to the library of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
