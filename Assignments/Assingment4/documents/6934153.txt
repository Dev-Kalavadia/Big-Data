Title: Flood Tide (novel)


Flood Tide is an adventure novel by Clive Cussler.  This is the 14th book featuring the author's primary protagonist, Dirk Pitt.

== Plot Summary ==
While recovering from his injuries suffered a month earlier as told in Shock Wave, Dirk stumbles upon mysterious activities around a peaceful lake in Washington state.  The coin of the realm for the wealthy, insatiably greedy Chinese smuggler is human lives: much of his vast fortune has been made smuggling Chinese immigrants into countries around the globe, including the United States.

Tracking the smuggler's activities leads Pitt from Washington State to Louisiana, where his quarry is constructing a huge shipping port in the middle of nowhere. Why has he chosen this unlikely location? The trail then leads to the race to find the site of the mysterious sinking of the ship that Chiang Kai-shek filled with treasure when he fled China in 1949, including the legendary boxes containing the bones of Peking Man that had vanished at the beginning of World War 1.

As Pitt prepares for a final showdown, he is faced with the most formidable foe he has ever encountered.
