Title: Methoxypropane
Methoxypropane, or methyl propyl ether, is an ether once used as a general anaesthetic.White, Mary Louise T.; Shane, Sylvan M.; Krantz, John C., Jr.  "Anesthesia. XXI. Propyl methyl ether as an inhalation anesthetic in man", Anesthesiology, (1946), 7, 663-7.  It is a clear colorless flammable liquid with a boiling point of 38.8 °C.Merck Index, 11th edition, 6031.

Marketed under the trade names Metopryl and Neothyl, methoxypropane was used as an alternative to diethyl ether because of its greater potency.  Its use as an anaesthetic has since been supplanted by modern halogenated ethers which are much less flammable.
