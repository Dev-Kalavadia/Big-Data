Title: Nausea (Beck song)

"Nausea" is a song by Beck. It was released as the first single from his 2006 album The Information. It reached #13 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The song appears in the 2010 film Repo Men.

"Nausea" is chiefly an acoustic song with elements of funk and heavy use of various percussion. Beck said he wanted the song "to sound like the Stooges in South America." When performed live, it is done in more of a punk rock vein, more akin to the Stooges.Beck Song Information – Nausea

Beck said that the song's music came quickly, as part of a 7-day marathon of jamming and writing and then going back and taking bits of the jam and expanding. He also said during a performance in May 2006 that he had written it a couple of years before. This would imply it was recorded during   one of the earlier sessions for the album.Beck Song Information – Nausea

"Nausea" made its live debut on May 24, 2006 in Davis, California. It was played on the Late Show with David Letterman, during which Sacha Baron Cohen's fictitious Borat made a guest appearance playing the berimbau. Before the performance, Letterman showed a copy of The Information with a sticker of his face on the front. Beck performed "Nausea" on Saturday Night Live on October 28, 2006.

Beck has performed the song close to 100 times. Although it was released as a single, it is not common for Beck to perform the song live.
