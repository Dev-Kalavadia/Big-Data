Title: Skjöldunga saga

The Skjöldunga saga (or, in another standardised Old Norse spelling, Skjǫldunga saga)  was an Old Norse legendary saga. Dating from c. 1180 – 1200, the saga was lost in its original form. The saga focused on the Danish dynasty of Scylding (Old Norse Skjöldung, plural Skjöldungar), the same semi-legendary dynasty featured in the Old English poem Beowulf. The fragmentary Icelandic text known as Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum is believed to be based on the Skjöldunga saga, perhaps deriving from a late version of that work.For an edition of materials relating to the Skjöldunga saga, see sǫgur: Skjǫldunga saga, Knýtlinga saga, Ágrip af sǫgu danakonunga Islenzk fornrit XXXV  ed. Bjarni Guðnason, Íslenzk Fornrit 35 (Reykjavík, 1982). Another surviving source that contains material from the saga (and continues where Sögubrot ends) is Arngrimur's Ad catalogum regum Sveciæ annotanda.The Sagas of Ragnar Lodbrok. Translated by Waggoner, Ben. New Haven: Troth Publications. 2009. p. xxv.

Arngrímur Jónsson paraphrased parts of it into Latin, and parts of it are thought to be preserved in other sagas, including Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta and Ragnarssona þáttr. It may relate to Saxo Grammaticus and contain a version of the story that inspired the lost Ur-Hamlet and ultimately William Shakespeare's Hamlet.For an English translation by Clarence H. Miller of Arngrímur Jónsson's paraphrase, with introduction and notes, see the journal AMQ, American Notes and Queries. Volume 20  20.3 (2007): 3-33.
