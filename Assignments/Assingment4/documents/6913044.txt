Title: Alphaville Amiga Compilation
Alphaville Amiga Compilation (1988) was released under the Amiga label; it was exclusive to the former East Germany, where Forever Young and Afternoons in Utopia weren't easily available. Two songs submitted for the compilation, "To Germany with Love" and "Summer in Berlin," were rejected by the label for political reasons.
