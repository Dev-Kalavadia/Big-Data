Title: Cound Halt railway station



Cound Halt was an unstaffed railway station on the Severn Valley line in Shropshire, England. It opened on 4 August 1934 and although thought by some people to have been closed as part of the Beeching axe in 1963 its planned closure pre-dated his report. The site of the station is now occupied by the beer garden of the adjacent Riverside Inn pub.
