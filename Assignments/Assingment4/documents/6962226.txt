In 1985, Herrmann returned to the University of Michigan as an assistant football coach.  He was promoted to the status of a full-time assistant coach at age 29 in December 1989.

Criticism of Herrman grew during the 2004 season and became even more heated as Michigan lost five games, compiled its worst record in 21 years, and gave up 244 points in 2005 (20.3 points per game).("Herrmann steered the M defense into a state of mediocrity after years of adjustments and tweaks ...")   In February 2006, Herrmann left Michigan to accept a position as linebackers coach with the New York Jets.  The Michigan Daily reported at the time that it was not clear whether "Herrmann chose to leave or fled before [he] could be fired or demoted."
