==History==

In 2011, The national team made their Twenty20 debut when they competed at the East Asia-Pacific Division 2 in Samoa winning over Indonesia, the Cook Islands, Tonga and South Korea before conceding defeat to the host nation in the final. The tournament was the Philippines' first International Cricket Council (ICC)-sanctioned match. The tournament was part of a qualifying pyramid for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka.

The Philippines then played at the 2014 ICC East Asia-Pacific Men's Championship in New South Wales, Australia and finished fifth among eight national teams. Indian expatriate, Awais Mohd became the first Philippine national team member to score a half-century in an ICC-sanctioned match while playing for the country in the EAP tournament.

At the 2017 ICC World Cricket League East Asia-Pacific Region Qualifiers, the Philippines finished fourth out of six nations, failing to qualify for Division Five.

The national team decided not to participate at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games as it seeks more Filipino players, sponsors and government support but plans to participate in the 2019 edition.

===2018–present===
They tried to attempt to qualify for the 2020 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Australia with the Philippines as one of the co-hosts of the East Asia-Pacific Qualifier. They advanced to the Regional Finals in Papua New Guinea after finishing first among four participating teams at the qualifiers hosted at the cricket ground of the Emilio Aguinaldo College in December 2018 in Dasmariñas, Cavite. 

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Philippines and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have been full T20Is. 

Philippines made its Twenty20 International debut on 22 March 2019, losing to Papua New Guinea by 133 runs in the 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup East Asia-Pacific Qualifier at Amini Park, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea The team would become inactive for three years due to the COVID-19 pandemic before featuring in the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup qualifiers.
