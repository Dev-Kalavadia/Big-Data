Title: Prathai district

Prathai (, ) is a district (amphoe) in the northeastern part of Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeastern Thailand.

==History==
Prathai village was settled in the Khmer era. King Jayavarman II set his camp in the area when he expanded his power to the west. After his reign, Prathai was deserted. It became a community again in the Sukhothai era.

Prathai in Khmer means 'camp'.

Tambon Prathai was separated from Bua Yai district to create a minor district (king amphoe) on 1 January 1961 and upgraded to a full district in 1963.
