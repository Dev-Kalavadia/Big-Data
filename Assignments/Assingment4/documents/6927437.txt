Title: Ytterøy


Ytterøy is a former municipality in the old Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. Originally, it was a large municipality that encompassed the island of Ytterøya and parts of the mainland to the northwest of the island on the west side of the Trondheimsfjord. By 1964 when it was dissolved, Ytterøy only included the  island of Ytterøya. Since 1964, the island has been part of what is now the municipality of Levanger in Trøndelag county. The island is connected to the rest of Levanger by a ferry that crosses the Trondheimsfjord. The main church for the municipality was Ytterøy Church.

==History==

The prestegjeld of Ytterøy was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1867, the mainland part of the municipality was separated from Ytterøy to form the new municipality of Mosvik og Verran (population: 2,949). This left a much smaller municipality of Ytterøy with 1,499 residents living on the island of Ytterøya. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Ytterøy was merged with the neighboring municipality of Levanger. Prior to the merger, Ytterøy had 772 residents.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Ytterøya (, or more recently ) since the first Ytterøy Church was built there. The first element of the original name is the definite singular form of  which means "island". The last element is  which means "outer". Thus the meaning of the name is "the outer island" (as opposed to the nearby Inderøy which means "the inner island"). Before the 20th century, the name was spelled Ytterøen.

==Government==
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.
