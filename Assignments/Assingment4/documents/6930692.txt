Title: 1962 South Carolina gubernatorial election


The 1962 South Carolina gubernatorial election was held on November 6, 1962 to select the governor of the state of South Carolina. Donald S. Russell won the Democratic primary and ran unopposed in the general election becoming the 107th governor of South Carolina.

==Democratic primary==
The South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary for governor in the summer of 1962 and Donald S. Russell succeeded on his second attempt by easily defeating the current Lieutenant Governor and son of former governor Burnet R. Maybank. He garnered more than 50% of the vote and avoided a runoff, effectively becoming the next governor of South Carolina due to lack of opposition in the general election.

==General election==
The general election was held on November 6, 1962 and Donald S. Russell was elected the next governor of South Carolina without opposition. Turnout was much higher than the previous gubernatorial election because of a competitive senate race between Olin D. Johnston and W. D. Workman, Jr.
