Hačava (1409 Hach, Bognerhey) (; ) is a village and municipality in Košice-okolie District in the Košice Region of eastern Slovakia.

==History==
First mention of the village is to be found in records dating back to 1409 when it was funded by German settlers driven here by a certain Master Wagner. In the 16th century it belonged to the noble family of Széchy. During that period, it was destroyed by Turks and suffered greatly because of the Polish-Lithuanian War. The place remained almost deserted. In the 18th century some Rusyn colonists contributed to repopulate the village.
