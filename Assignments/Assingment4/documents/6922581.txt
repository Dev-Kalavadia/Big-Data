Title: Blue Rodeo Live in Stratford

Live in Stratford is the generic name given to two "official bootleg" albums recorded by Blue Rodeo in January 2006. Instant Live recorded two concerts held at the Festival Theatre in Stratford, Ontario and burned them onto CDs ready for purchase about 15 minutes after each show. Each album contains two discs.

==Details of the shows==

Blue Rodeo's Stratford shows are done differently from their normal concerts; Blue Rodeo performs two sets with an intermission, and there is no opening act. The shows are performed in the Festival Theatre, generally in January when the Stratford Festival is not running. The Stratford concerts are produced by Chris Parson of Standing Ovation Productions.

The January 14 show features guest singer Kate Boothman performing the female vocal on "Can't Help Wondering Why". A running joke has Greg and Jim mistakenly calling her "Kate Brickman", based on an incorrect news article about the show.

Bazil Donovan will often sing one song during a concert, and "Stage Door" is his contribution to the Stratford shows.

The James Inveldt song "Crying Over You" is also featured on the In Stereovision DVD.
