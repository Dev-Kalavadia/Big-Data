Title: Cadenazzo

Cadenazzo is a municipality in the district of Bellinzona, in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. On 13 March 2005 the formerly independent municipality of Robasacco was absorbed into Cadenazzo.

==History==
Cadenazzo is first mentioned in 1335 as Catenacii, when the hospitallis de Cadenazio was mentioned.  The existence of a medieval castle is in doubt.  The collegiate church of San Pietro in Bellinzona owned part of the village by 1438.  The chapel of S. Pietro Martire in Cadenazzo may have been built in the 13th century, but the earliest mention of the chapel is from 1363.  However, the chapel has not survived into the modern era and its location is unknown.  In 1442, Cadenazzo separated from the mother church of Bellinzona joined the parish of the neighboring village of S. Antonino.  They remained part of a joint parish until 1830.

Agriculture, once dominant, but not very profitable, is still common in the Magadino valley.  Crop yields increased after the correction of Ticino river.  Since 1973, Cadenazzo has been home to a branch of the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology and Agriculture.  Due to some industrial enterprises, shops and warehouses in the vicinity of the train station, Cadenazzo draw commuters from surrounding communities.
