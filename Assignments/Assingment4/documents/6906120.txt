Title: The Runners (production duo)



The Runners are an American electronic and hip hop production duo from Orlando, Florida, consisting of Andrew "Dru Brett" Harr and Jermaine "Mayne Zayne" Jackson. They came together to form the team in 2000, but they have known each other since they were in kindergarten. They both have been influenced their entire lives by producers Timbaland and the Neptunes. Their trademark is an exhale sound effect ringing "Ahhh" at the beginning of their songs.

They are best known for producing the hit singles "Go Hard" and "Hustlin'", by rappers DJ Khaled and Rick Ross respectively. Also worked with Cubic Z on a number of DJ Khaled productions. They have produced songs for artists like Keyshia Cole, Kevin Cossom, Ace Hood, Chris Brown, Fat Joe, Juelz Santana, Nelly, Trip Lee, Jim Jones, Lil Wayne, Fabolous and Usher.

==History==

The Runners first met as toddlers in Vero Beach, Florida. In 2000, they named themselves the Runners and set up shop in Orlando, where they launched Trac-N-Field Entertainment. In 2008, the Runners were nominated for Producer of the Year at the BET Awards.

They produced two tracks on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, "Cheers (Drink to That)" and "California King Bed". They have also produced British singer-rapper Cher Lloyd's debut single "Swagger Jagger". On March 31, 2012, they went in the studio to produce for Shakira.
