Title: Jake Eisenhart

Jacob Henry "Ol' Jake" Eisenhart (October 3, 1922 – December 20, 1987) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who appeared in one game for the Cincinnati Reds in 1944. The 6'3½", 195 lb. left-hander was a native of Perkasie, Pennsylvania.

Eisenhart is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II. After attending Juniata College, he was signed by the Reds to a 30-day trial contract, but his only big league action came on June 10,  in a home game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Crosley Field. He entered the game with two out in the top of the ninth inning, and the Reds behind 18–0. The pitcher he came in to relieve was 15-year-old Joe Nuxhall, who had just made his major league debut. Eisenhart walked the first batter he faced, George Fallon, then got the last out, retiring opposing pitcher Mort Cooper on a foul out.The Cardinals scored 18 runs, left 18 men on base and made 27 outs, meaning the final two batters were the last two men in the batting order.  His total major league experience ended up lasting only 1/3 of an inning. He was released by the Reds on June 24. Eisenhart also served in the Army during World War II, and toiled three years in the Philadelphia Athletics organization, but never made it back to the major leagues. He died in 1987 in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.
