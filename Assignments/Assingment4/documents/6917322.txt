Title: Glaslyn Rural District

Glaslyn was a rural district in the administrative county of Caernarfonshire from 1894 to 1934.

The district was formed under the Local Government Act 1894  from the part of Festiniog Rural Sanitary District in Caernarfonshire. The district was named after Glaslyn, a lake at the centre of the area.

The district contained three civil parishes:
*Beddgelert 			
*Dolbenmaen 
*Treflys 

The rural district was abolished by a County Review Order in 1934. Beddgelert passed to Gwyrfai Rural District, and Dolbenmaen to Ll≈∑n Rural District. Treflys parish was abolished, most of it becoming part of Dolbenmaen parish, with parts going to the urban districts of Criccieth and Porthmadog.
