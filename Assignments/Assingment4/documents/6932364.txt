thumb|left|upright|Frescoes on the village church from the 17th Century
During the mid-19th Century, the population declined sharply due to emigration to other countries and a rural exodus.  The parish church of Madonna delle Grazie was already in operation in the 15th Century.  It was expanded in the beginning of the 16th Century.  In 1513, it broke away from the parish of Cevio.  The church contains frescoes and stucco from the 17th century.

The soil around Cerentino is rich in limestone, which was used in construction and in the production of lime for mortar.  The villages are threatened by landslides and continual erosion.

Modernly, animal husbandry and agriculture, which earlier granted the villages a far-reaching self-sufficiency, is still main income source of most residents.  In the summer months there is some tourism to the municipality.
