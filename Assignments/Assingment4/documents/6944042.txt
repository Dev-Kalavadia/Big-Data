Title: Implicational hierarchy
Implicational hierarchy, in linguistics, is a chain of implicational universals. A set of chained universals is schematically shown as in (1):

(1)	A < B < C < D

It can be reformulated in the following way: If a language has property D, then it also has properties A, B, and C; if a language has a property C, then it also has properties A and B, etc. In other words, the implicational hierarchy defines the possible combinations of properties A, B, C, and D as listed in matrix (2):
{| class="wikitable"
! width="50"| ||width="25"|A||width="25"|B||width="25"|C||width="25"|D
|-
| Type 1: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|+ ||align='center'|+ ||align='center'|+
|-
| Type 2: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|+ ||align='center'|+ ||align='center'|-
|-
| Type 3: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|+ ||align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|-
| Type 4: || align='center'|+ || align='center'|- ||align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|-
| Type 5: || align='center'|- || align='center'|- ||align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|}

Implicational hierarchies are a useful tool in capturing linguistic generalizations 
pertaining the different components of the language. They are found in all subfields of grammar.

==Phonology==
(3) is an example of an implicational hierarchy concerning the distribution of nasal phonemes across languages, which concerns dental/alveolar, bilabial, and palatal voiced nasals, 
respectively: 
 
(3)       <       <  

This hierarchy defines the following possible combinations of dental/alveolar, bilabial, and palatal voiced nasals in 
the phoneme inventory of a language:

(4) 
{| class="wikitable"
! width="50"| ||width="30"| ||width="30"|||width="30"|
|-
| Type 1: || align='center'| || align='center'| ||align='center'|
|-
| Type 2: || align='center'| || align='center'| || align='center'|-
|-
| Type 3: || align='center'| || align='center'|- ||align='center'|-
|}
In other words, the hierarchy implies that there are no languages with  but without  and , or with  and  but without  .

==Morphology==
Number marking provides an example of implicational hierarchies in morphology.

(5) Number: singular < plural < dual < trial / paucal

On the one hand, the hierarchy implies that no language distinguishes a trial unless having a dual, and no language has dual without a plural. On the other hand, the hierarchy provides implications for the morphological marking: if the plural is coded with a certain number of morphemes, then the dual is coded with at least as many morphemes.

==Syntax==
Implicational hierarchies also play a role in syntactic phenomena. For instance, in some languages (e.g. Tangut) the transitive verb agrees not with a subject, or the object, but with the syntactic argument which is higher on the person hierarchy.

(5) Person: first < second < third
