== History ==

The road along the east bank of the Mystic River, connecting the villages of Mystic and Old Mystic, was a secondary state highway in the 1920s, with designation Highway 344. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, old Highway 344 was renumbered to Route 169. In 1950, a new state highway was established, Route 27, which connected the village of Poquetanuck in the town of Preston (at Route 12), through Ledyard Center, to Burnetts Corner in Groton (at Route 184).

Route 27 was established in 1950, running from Route 12 in Ledyard to Route 184. The old Route 27 followed the path of the Colonel Ledyard Highway. By the following year, Route 27 was extended along old Route 169 via a short overlap with Route 184. As a result of the 1961 Route Reclassification Act, the part of old Route 27 north of Route 184 was deleted in 1963, leading to its current configuration.Connecticut Roads, Route 27
