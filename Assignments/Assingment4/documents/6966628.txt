=== Xombie ===
Xombie tells the story of a little girl named Zoe, who washes ashore years after a zombie plague has wiped out most life on Earth and replaced it with bloodthirsty reanimated versions of the planet's previous inhabitants. She is saved from a swarm of zombies by Dirge, a "variant", a zombie who has retained their conscious mind and the ability to think like a human. (According to the official website, the variants are called "xombies", but the term has yet to be used in the series itself, likely because it is pronounced the same way as "zombie".) Dirge takes it upon himself to perform one last good deed before his zombie body withers away and begins a journey to reunite Zoe with the few remaining live humans and save her from a gruesome death at the hands of the undead.

In 2007, Farr released a book displaying the events of the first saga of the series, entitled Xombie: Dead On Arrival. There is also a six issue comic book series called Xombie: Reanimated, the first issue was released April 2007. A third part of the intended Xombie trilogy, titled Death Warmed Over, was planned but put on indefinite hold due to an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign.

In March 2017, Farr began a new series on YouTube titled Xombie: Dead Ahead, which is meant to be a continuation of the series, proclaimed as "the next chapter".

=== Trainsformers ===

A short-lived animated series mashing up Thomas & Friends and Transformers starring Farr's son Vector. This includes a reborn episode released on March 31, 2021.

After the fourth episode, HIT Entertainment (later Mattel Creations, then Fred Rogers Productions) sued Farr for plagiarism due to Thomas having a strict copyright protection. Because of this the first four episodes were pulled from the internet and a fifth was made involving what could have been the fifth episode being halted by the "Fun Police" mid-production causing Vector to go on new adventures around the movie lot.

The series was replaced by The Sky-High City of Steampuff, which also featured trains that can turn into robots and lasted four episodes, with a fifth currently in development.

Before the sixth episode, Farr gets revenge on HIT Entertainment/Mattel Creations from suing him for plagiarism by shutting HIT Entertainment/Mattel Creations down, make the production team of HIT Entertainment/Mattel Creations lose their jobs, and get Thomas out of this production to have strict copyright protection cut off. Despite this the first four episodes were brought back to the internet for fair use or remastered for the 10-year anniversary on April 19, 2019, TRAINS-FORMERS: Gauge of Extinction was made involving for Vector disregarding from going on new adventures around the movie lot and to get revenge to the Fun Police and bring Trainsformers back again.

On December 31, 2018, James Farr fully restored the Trainsformers, but in the Christmas special, generic trains (whose names were Cole, Quazar, Quark and Clunk) were added instead of Thomas characters. This is probably due so HIT Entertainment will not sue James again.

Due to HIT Entertainment's loss of Thomas, Farr properly used Thomas for future videos after getting permission from Mattel or Fred Rogers Productions. As he later on remastered all 4 episodes with the first 2 having different music due to copyright issues and in the last remastered episode Vector sent a message to the viewers saying that if James gets to 500,000 Subscribers, Vector can get Thomas back online.
