Title: Valentine's Day (TV series)


Valentine's Day is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from September 18, 1964 until May 7, 1965. The series starred Tony Franciosa as Valentine Farrow, a swinging Manhattan publishing executive, and Jack Soo (later of Barney Miller) as Rocky Sin, a poker-playing con-artist and Farrow's valet.  The show was created by Hal Kanter and lasted only one season.

One noteworthy episode was produced as a tie-in to the movie Rio Conchos,  in which Franciosa co-starred; he played both Valentine and his character, Juan Luis Martinez, from the feature.
