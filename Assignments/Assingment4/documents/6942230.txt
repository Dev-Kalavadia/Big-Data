Title: Love Among Thieves


Love Among Thieves is a 1987 American romantic thriller television film directed by Roger Young, starring Audrey Hepburn, Robert Wagner, Patrick Bauchau, Jerry Orbach, Brion James, and Samantha Eggar. It premiered on ABC on February 23, 1987. The ending left the door open for either a sequel or possibly a television series, but neither eventuated. Reportedly, Hepburn donated her salary to UNICEF. Love Among Thieves is notable for several reasons. It was the only made-for-television film in which Hepburn appeared (although she had done some live drama productions in the 1950s). It was also the last film in which she took a starring role (her next, and final, film performance in 1989's Always was a cameo).

This was the first Hepburn film since 1981's They All Laughed. It contains a number of intentional references to Hepburn's earlier films, mostly in dialogue, although the basic plot borrows from her 1960s films Charade, Paris, When It Sizzles and How to Steal a Million. The film includes her final on-screen kiss (with Wagner).

On October 6, 2009, the film became available on DVD through the Warner Archive Collection.
