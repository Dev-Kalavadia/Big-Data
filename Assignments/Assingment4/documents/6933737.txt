==History==

===Prehistory===
In 1909–10, work on the banks of the Ticino river in the hamlet of Progero uncovered an extensive prehistoric burial ground.  This site, known as A Progero is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  The oldest finds are pottery fragments, indicating that the area was probably inhabited in the Early Bronze Age (17th–16th century BC).  The next layer of finds included grave pottery from the Late Bronze Age (13th–12th century BC).  Most of the necropolis (over 300 graves) dates from the Iron Age (6th century BC).  This settlement is from the Golasecca culture and lasted until about the 2nd century BC.  The graves from this period are almost exclusively full-body burials.  The graves are surrounded by stone walls and covered with boards or stones arranged around the top.  In some cases the stele stones with inscriptions have been found close to the graves.

Many of the late Bronze Age grave goods come in the form of bi-conical, lens-like urns.  Typical of the Golasecca era, most graves have one or more ceramic vessels (urns, bowls, mugs and more rarely jugs) along with ornaments made of bronze (brooches, earrings, pendant, belt buckles) and amber (necklaces, earrings and beads).  Some of the bronze vessels are situlas (bucket-like containers), but the other typical vessels of the Golasecca culture (such as beak jugs) have not been found.  Particularly noteworthy is a bucket (from the turn of the 6th to the 5th century BC) carved with characters in the Lugano or Lepontic.

The cemetery continued to be used after the Golasecca era.  Items have been found from the Latène era.  When the Celtic groups came across the Alps to the South Alpine region and penetrated the Po Valley, they settled around Gudo and used the cemetery.  Grave goods from these eras include ceramic tableware, La Tène type brooches, beads of glass paste and amber, bronze or silver rings and pendants.

===Medieval Gudo===
The modern village of Gudo is first mentioned in 1277 as Gudio.  In 1264, the Knights Hospitaller of Contone, the council of Como, the cathedrals of Bellinzona and Locarno, and the Locarno noble families of Muralto and Magoria all owned land in Gudo.  Gudo documented its citizens' rights in 1363, and Progero is mentioned as a separate community.  In Progero the Church of Santa Maria, was rebuilt in the 17th century.  Here, according to legend, existed a Benedictine monastery.  Gudo and Sementina separated from the mother church in Bellinzona in 1440.  Excavations around the parish church of S. Lorenzo in 1992, found a predecessor church from the 6th–7th centuries.  This church is the oldest church building that has been archaeologically examined in the Bellinzona area.  The present church dates back to 1615 and was restored between 1990 and 2000.

===Modern Gudo===
In 1888, the Ticino river course was corrected, leading to a rise in populations.  In 1907 the iron bridge was built, which allowed a road to connects the Maggiore Valley with Cadenazzo.  In 1932–36 the Canton built a farm (Demanio agricolo) in Gudo.

The economy of the municipality is based around agriculture in the Maggiore Valley.  Vineyards grow along the slopes above town, and at the beginning of the 20th century Gudo was the most important center of Ticino's wine industry.  Even today, the vineyards are among the largest in the canton. Gudo is primarily a residential community, and in 2000, most residents worked outside the community.
