Title: Kingdom of Doom

"Kingdom of Doom" is a song by the British alternative rock supergroup the Good, the Bad & the Queen, made up of Damon Albarn, Paul Simonon, Simon Tong and Tony Allen and is the fourth track on their 2007 album The Good, the Bad & the Queen (see 2007 in British music).

The song was also released as the band's second single in January 2007. Note that the single release, issued a week before the album came out, quite clearly credits the artist as The Good, The Bad & The Queen, although Albarn later claimed the band was unnamed, and that The Good, The Bad & The Queen was simply the name of the album.

Upon release, the single charted at #20, the only one of the band's three singles to reach the Top 20.
