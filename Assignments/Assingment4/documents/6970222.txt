During the 2003 season, Sutton helped the Montreal Impact become the USL squad with the lowest goals allowed total and won the Goalkeeper of the Year honor.

On November 29, 2006, Sutton returned to MLS, having been allocated to the newly formed Toronto FC for the 2007 season. Sutton was the team's starting goalkeeper until he received a head concussion during CONCACAF Gold Cup training with Canada in June. Due to recurring symptoms, he did not return until the 2008 season.

Sutton was dropped for the 2008 season opener in favour of draft pick Brian Edwards, but made his return against D.C. United at RFK Stadium in Toronto's second game. He conceded four goals but made a number of important saves. He retained his position for the next three games, recording three straight shutouts in April.

After the signing of German goalkeeper Frank Rost, Sutton was loaned out to Canadian North American Soccer League team Montreal Impact on July 16, 2011. As part of the loan agreement, Montreal was given the option to acquire Sutton's MLS rights at the end of the season as the club prepared for a move to MLS in 2012.
