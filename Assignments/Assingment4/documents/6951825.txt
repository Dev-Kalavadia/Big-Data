==History==

Contone is first mentioned in 1152 as Gondono.  However, three tombs have been discovered in Contone, which can be dated earlier than the Early Middle Ages.  These tombs date to the reopening of the alpine passes.

Some time before 1219, a Hospital of the Knights Hospitaller was built in the village.  However, the exact foundation year and location are controversial.  It was later Commandry of the Order of Malta.  In the 16th century, the Commandry estates went to the hospital in Lugano and in 1811 to the Antognini family of Bellinzona.

In 1104, the Lombard nobleman Wido Samarate built or rebuilt a church and presented it to the Benedictine monastery of S. Giorgio in Quartino.  The church, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas, was incorporated in 1152 into the parish of Locarno.  It was closed in 1769 and fell apart.  The parish church of S. Giovanni Battista was built in the 16th century church, on the site of the hospital church.

The inhabitants of Contone lived as herders and farmers, mostly on the lowest part of the slope of Mount Ceneri.  After 1850, the employment situation changed because of the decline of the port of Magadino and railway construction.  Many inhabitants emigrated abroad and found work as painters, plasterers and stove-makers.  With immigration of, mainly Italian, day laborers, the population began to grow.  At the end of the 20th century most jobs were in the services sector.  After the correction of the Ticino river, the vast, formerly marshy plain became home to a number of commercial and industrial buildings.
