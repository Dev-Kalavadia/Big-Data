Title: Algorithm (C++)

In the C++ Standard Library, algorithms are components that perform algorithmic operations on containers and other sequences.ISO/IEC (2003). ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ ยง25 Algorithms library [lib.algorithms] para. 1

The C++ standard provides some standard algorithms collected in the <algorithm> standard header. A handful of algorithms are also in the <numeric> header. All algorithms are in the  namespace.

==Categories of algorithms==
The algorithms in the C++ Standard Library can be organized into the following categories.
* Non-modifying sequence operations (e.g. , , )
* Modifying sequence operations (e.g. , , )
* Sorting (e.g. sort, , )
* Binary search (e.g. , ) 
* Heap (e.g. , )
* Min/max (e.g. , )

==Examples==
* 
* 
*  (returns an iterator the found object or , if the object isn't found)
*  returns the greater of the two arguments
*  finds the maximum element of a range
*  returns the smaller of the two arguments
*  finds the minimum element of a range
