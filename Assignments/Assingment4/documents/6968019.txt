Graves found in Pazz and Traversagna suggest a nearby Iron Age settlement.  In the Early Middle Ages the monastery of S. Abbondio of Como owned property in the village, while the Como Cathedral owned a farm and mill near Novaggio.  In 1294, the Humiliati monastery of Astano owned a house and property in the village.  At that time Novaggio, Curio, Banco and Bedigliora formed a kastlanei.  There were certainly several fortifications around the village, but the exact location, number and type is unknown.
