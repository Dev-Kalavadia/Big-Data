Title: Mockingbird (Derek Webb album)



Mockingbird (2005) is the third solo studio album from singer-songwriter Derek Webb.

Produced by Cason Cooley, the album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in what he sees as some of the greatest problems the world is facing today."Derek Webb: Mockingbird"  (PDF).

The Work of the People (a community of artists, storytellers, filmmakers, poets and theologians) created a music video for Webb's song A New Law which is available for viewing on their website.

To broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website www.freederekwebb.com, where it was available for download until December 8, 2006.Underwood, Ryan (September 14, 2006). www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006609140378 "Can You Make Money Giving Away CDs?"
