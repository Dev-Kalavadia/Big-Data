In 1991, he received the Lila Wallace–Reader's Digest Writer's Award and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship.

Klinkenborg's books include More Scenes from the Rural Life (Princeton Architectural Press), Making Hay and The Last Fine Time.

His book Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile concerns the tortoise which the English eighteenth century parson-naturalist Gilbert White inherited from his aunt, as described in his 1789 book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. In the first half of 2006, Klinkenborg posted a farm and garden blog  about The Rural Life, consisting of entries from the daily journal kept by Gilbert White in Selborne in 1784, and his own complementary daily entries.Klinkenborg's 2006 New York Times garden blog.
