Title: Drexel University College of Arts and Sciences


The College of Arts and Sciences (CoAS) is one of the many colleges at Drexel University. It was formed in 1990 when Drexel merged the two existing College of Sciences and College of Humanities together.

==History==
Founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry. In 1914, the School of Engineering employed full professors for English, mathematics, and chemistry.  The College of Science was created in 1968 and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences was created in 1970.

In 1990 the present-day College of Arts and Science was created from a combination of the College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.  This consolidation was mainly a result of a downturn in enrollments and fiscal shortfalls at the time.  After the merger with MCP/Hahnemann in 2002, several departments within the college were reorganized, which resulted in the creation of the Department of Psychology, the Department of Culture and Communication, and the Department of English and Philosophy.  In addition, Computer Science was separated from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and moved to the College of Engineering and the School of Education was separated from the College of Arts and Sciences.

==Present==
The current structure of the college is made up of fourteen departments and one interdisciplinary major program that interact with each other as well as with a broad array of units throughout the university.  The college's level of involvement in teaching across the university is exhibited by the fact that the college teaches approximately 35% of the total student credit hours of the university each year."Strategic Plan" (March 2004), College of Arts and Sciences, Drexel University.
