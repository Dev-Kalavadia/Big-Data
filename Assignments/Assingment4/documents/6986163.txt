Title: The Prids



The Prids are an American post-punk/indie rock band based in Portland, Oregon, led by former couple David Frederickson and Mistina La Fave. AllMusic described them as specializing in "a moody form of indie rock influenced by '80s college radio stalwarts",. and their influences include the Smiths, Unrest, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Built to Spill, Wire and Sonic Youth.

The Prids are known for following a strong DIY ethic, including the home recording of several of their records, booking their own tours and running their own Portland label collective, This-a-Way Records.

== History ==
The Prids were founded in the small town of St. Joseph, Missouri, in 1995 by Frederickson (guitar, vocals) and La Fave (bass, vocals). The band name was a reference to a pet name that Frederickson had for La Fave. The group continued to develop in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, and in Lincoln, they befriended Harry Dingman III, guitarist of 1980s post-punk band For Against.
 
After adding Jairus Smith (drums) and Trenor Rapkins (keyboards), the band relocated to Portland in November 1999, and released their debut EP, Duracraft, in 2000 on the Death Tech Music label, featuring cover artwork by Dingman. In a contemporaneous live review, the Portland Mercury described the Prids as: "Imagine if My Bloody Valentine and New Order decided to collaborate when they were both at their peaks".

Their second EP, Glide, Screamer, was self-released in 2002. Drummer Lee Zeman replaced Smith for their debut full-length album, Love Zero, released on May 6, 2003, by Luminal Records. In 2004 Eric Hold replaced Smith, and the band released two 7-inch singles on Luminal: "Let It Go" and "Shadow and Shadow". In 2005, the band added drummer Joey Maas, replacing Zeman.

The Prids signed with New York-based label Five03 Records, who released a second album, ...Until the World Is Beautiful (August 29, 2006) and a third EP, Something Difficult (October 9, 2007). Hold then left the band, replaced by Maile Arruda.

On July 20, 2008, the Prids were involved in a serious highway accident while driving south from San Francisco to Los Angeles. All four members and two of their significant others were injured to varying degrees, and their van and gear were destroyed. In the aftermath of the accident, fans and friends worldwide donated over $16,000 to help the band with medical bills and equipment costs, and Five03 released a digital-only benefit/tribute album, Dots to Connect: The Music of the Prids, featuring Prids covers by A Place to Bury Strangers, the Suffocation Keep (with Brett Nelson of Built to Spill), The Upsidedown, Entertainment, Helvetia (band) and others.

In 2009, the Prids issued the song "Break" on a split single with Lookbook. The band's third album, Chronosynclastic, featuring guest guitar from Doug Martsch of Built to Spill, was released on the Velvet Blue Music label on June 11, 2010.

In 2015, the Prids (with drummer Gordon Nickel and keyboardist Cass Yates replacing Zeman and Arruda)  celebrated their 20th anniversary as a band, and announced plans to release a fourth album.
