== Football career ==

=== Club career ===
Rubarth was a technical left-winger who liked to dribble past defenders from the left side of the pitch, even though he was right footed. He regularly provided strikers with good passes and consequently got quite a few assists during his career. During the 2003 season, which arguably was Rubarth's best, he also proved to be an able goal scorer, scoring ten times that season in Allsvenskan. One of his more famous goals was however scored in 2001 against local rivals Hammarby IF when he scored with a spectacular bicycle kick.

Though not a physical player, Rubarth picked up a staggering amount of yellow cards and quite a few red cards too. In 2003, he managed to get sent-off twice in a row. First against Helsingborgs IF in Allsvenskan and then in the next match against Fylkir in the UEFA Cup.Nötter mellan jul och nyår
