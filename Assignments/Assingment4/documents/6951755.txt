Title: Everything! (Tones on Tail album)



Everything! is a compilation album by post-punk band Tones on Tail, released in 1998 as a double CD.

The first disc features the original Pop album, while the second disc collects the Burning Skies and Tones on Tail EPs, along with the "There's Only One!", "Performance", "Lions" and "Christian Says" singles. The order of songs "When You're Smiling" and "You, the Night and the Music" was reversed on this compilation. Included as a bonus was a live performance of Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" (the only officially released Tones on Tail live recording), followed by a radio interview with Daniel Ash.

A handful of alternate mixes were not released as part of this collection: the radio edits of "Go!" and "Burning Skies", as well as an extended mix of "Twist", were released on the promo EP Something!.

"Copper" was originally designated as playable at either 45 or  RPM, as it was originally released on vinyl; the 45 RPM version of the song is included in this set.

==Reception==
Writing for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett said that the need for a complete compilation of Tones on Tail work "was long overdue". Describing the group's underground hit "Go!", he said: "It remains a wonderful, atypical dancefloor smash, with Ash's loopy 'ya-ya' chorus, Haskins' nutty percussion patterns, Campling's great fuzz bassline, and more all coming together in weird and fun ways".
