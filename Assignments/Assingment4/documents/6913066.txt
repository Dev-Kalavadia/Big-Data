Title: June Afternoon

"June Afternoon" is a song by Swedish pop music duo Roxette, released in January 1996 as the second single from their second greatest hits compilation album, Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus! Roxette's Greatest Hits (1995). The single was only released in Europe, Australia, and Canada, peaking at number one in the Czech Republic and within the top 40 in numerous territories. Its accompanying music video was directed by Jonas Åkerlund.

Written by Per Gessle, the song was predominantly recorded by members of Gyllene Tider—Gessle's former band. The single was backed by the previously unreleased demo "Seduce Me", which was written by Marie Fredriksson and Gessle for the duo's 1991 album, Joyride. It was later included on the 2006 release of The Rox Box/Roxette 86-06.
