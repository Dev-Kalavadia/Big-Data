The song pays homage to two elderly people: a gentleman who, despite being 80 years old still works daily and is still bitter over the Brooklyn Dodgers' franchise move to Los Angeles; and a grandmother who maintains a sweet disposition and bakes delicious pies despite severe arthritis. Because of their old age, people sometimes look upon them with disdain and discomfort because of their ways, but as the singers remind, "One day we will be old folks too."
