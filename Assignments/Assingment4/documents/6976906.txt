Title: Operation Blue Hearts
During the Korean War, Operation Bluehearts was the American amphibious landing conducted at Pohang on 18 July 1950 by the First Cavalry Division. The town was still in friendly hands, but was in the path of the rapid North Korean advance. The American units quickly joined the defenders. 

This landing, planned on extremely short notice, attracted little attention at the time, but pointed the way towards critical landing at Inchon (Operation Chromite).
