Title: I See Things Upside Down

I See Things Upside Down (2004) is the second solo studio album from singer-songwriter Derek Webb. It was recorded at The Smoakstack recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee and engineered by Justin Loucks. This album branches out musically from what Webb had done in the past, and Webb has stated that he wanted to "dismantle everyone's idea of what kind of music they could expect" from him.Derek Webb, 01/06 - Interviews - Christian Music Today

Referencing the paradoxes provided in Christ's teachings, I See Things Upside Down investigates the idea that perhaps, contrary to our religious and social standards, failure equals success, poverty equals riches, weakness equals strength, and foolishness equals understanding.derekwebb.net, popular fansite “What are the things that we American Christians value in our culture and how is that different and often ‘upside down’ from true Kingdom values? I’ve found that often success looks more like failure, riches more like poverty, and that real life often feels more like death,” Webb said in a press release.

==Reception==

Webb's second album was well-received by both fans and critics alike. Sonically folksy-rock, I See Things Upside Down wasted no time mincing words or sugarcoating Webb's perception of the state of the Church and the American faith culture. This criticism shouldn't be taken as disdain, per se, as Webb continues to assert he is particularly passionate about the Church. In an interview with Cross Rhythms, Webb said, "It's the same dilemma patriots have always had. Patriots love their government enough to be able to criticise it. I love the Church; the Church needs to hear the Gospel. I feel very encouraged at the camaraderie I have felt with college kids, families, even pastors, as we all share our concerns. If I can continue doing this, I am very happy."  Derek Webb: US Singer/songwriter talks about his ministry
