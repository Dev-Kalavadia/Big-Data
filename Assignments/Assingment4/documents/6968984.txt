Title: Nova Scotia Oilers

The Nova Scotia Oilers were a minor professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League based in Halifax, Nova Scotia from 1984 to 1988. The Oilers played their home games at the Halifax Metro Centre, and were the AHL affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers, whose logo theirs resembled.

The Oilers played four seasons before moving on. Larry Kish coached the first three seasons, followed by Ron Low in the fourth season. After the 1987–88 season, the team was relocated to Sydney, Nova Scotia becoming the Cape Breton Oilers. The void the Oilers left in Halifax was filled by the Halifax Citadels.
