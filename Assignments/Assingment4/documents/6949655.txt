Title: Life and Work (magazine)


Life and Work is the editorially independent monthly magazine of the Church of Scotland. It was founded in 1879 by Archibald Hamilton Charteris. The first issue was published in January 1880 under the editorship of Rev Archibald Clerk from Lorn.

It incorporated the Mission Record of the Church of Scotland from 1900, and at the 1929 union of the Church, it merged with United Free Church's The Record as Life and Work: The Record of the Church of Scotland.

Life and Work was an initiative of the Church's Committee of Christian Life and Work, which was led by Charteris, a professor of biblical criticism at Edinburgh University who was also founder of the Woman's Guild. 
  
Life and Work has a 4-page Gaelic supplement, Na Duilleagan Gàidhlig, established in 1880, which is included on request, and is also available online.

The current editor is Lynne McNeil.

In January 2006 the magazine reverted to its older title Life and Work, instead of Life & Work.

In April 2013 a Life and Work website was launched, including extracts from the magazine as well as additional news and features.
