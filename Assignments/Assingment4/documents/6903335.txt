After the announcement Iran national team coach Carlos Queiroz made a comment that he respected Rahmati's decision and would not invite him any more. Many in the Iranian FA tried to convince him to invite Rahmati again but Queiroz said that he was not involved in the decision and he could not see any reason to negotiate this matter with Rahmati.

In March 2013 Rahmati made a comment that Queiroz should not be the coach of Iran and the best he could do was to help as the assistant.
