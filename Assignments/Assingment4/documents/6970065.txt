Title: Broadmoor Skating Club

The Broadmoor Skating Club is a figure skating club based in Colorado Springs, Colorado that has long been a major training center for the sport of figure skating.  Founded in 1939, it was originally known as the Pikes Peak Skating Club, and was based in the Broadmoor World Arena on the grounds of The Broadmoor resort.  When that facility was demolished in 1994, the club moved to its current home at the Broadmoor World Arena (1998).

More recently, the club has hosted events such as the World Junior Figure Skating Championships, the Four Continents Championships, Skate America, and the Grand Prix Final.
