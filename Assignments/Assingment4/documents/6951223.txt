==History==
thumb|left|Luserte in Quartino, a neighborhood in Magadino
Magadino is first mentioned in 1254 as de Magadino.  It was also previously known, in German, as Megadin though this name is no longer used.

During the Late Middle Ages the village was mentioned when certain feudal rights were transferred from the Bishop of Como to the Capitanei of Locarno transferred.  Until 1342, these rights included the right to collect tolls on goods traveling through the area.  The village of Quartino was, in the 11th to 16th Centuries, a Benedictine priory.  The priory of St. George belonged to the abbey of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria in Piedmont, then to S. Gemolo di Ganna in Lombardy.  In the 17th Century the monastic estates came to the hospital in Locarno.

Together with the villages of Quartino and Orgnana, Magadino belonged to the parish of S. Pietro in Vira, until it became an independent parish in 1846.  The church of San Carlo was built in 1844-46.

The Codice delle strade di Como (1335) mentions a tower in Magadino, though no trace of the tower has been found.  A castle is also mentioned in a chronicle from the 17th century, but it is also lost.  The chronicle says it was built in 1365 on the orders of Galeazzo Visconti for the inhabitants of Locarno and destroyed in 1518 by the Swiss.

Magadino was a major port and an important customs station at the transit route north from Lombardy to the cities of the Alps, and its importance grew in 1515 after the collapse of the bridge over the Ticino river at Bellinzona.  With the introduction of regular steamship traffic (1826) and the opening of the road over the Gotthard Pass (1830) Magadino became a stop on the coach routes.  Many new warehouses, hotels and restaurants were built, some of which are still visible today.  The decline of the port began with the opening of the railway lines to Locarno (1874) and Luino (1882).  The town stagnated between the 1880s until the 1960s.  In 2000, the majority of the population worked outside the village.  In 2005, almost half of the jobs were in the services sector.
