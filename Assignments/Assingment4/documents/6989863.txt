Title: Tibor Csík





 


Tibor Csík 2 September, 1927- was a bantamweight professional boxer from Hungary, who won the gold medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

He was born in Jászberény into a poor family. He began boxing in featherweight and later changed to bantamweight. A two-time Hungarian champion from 1946 and 1948, his biggest success was the Olympic Games gold medal he won in London.

Csik had an easy route to the semi-finals, as his first opponent was disqualified, and his quarter final opponent Jimmy Carruthers of Australia, was forced to withdraw due to an eye injury. In the final, Csik won a decision over Giovanni Zuddas of Italy, to win the gold medal. After his return to Hungary he was awarded the honorary citizenship of Jászberény.

He actively participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which eventually was struck down by the invading Soviet Army and Csík had to flee Hungary. He settled in Australia, where he died in 1976. He was buried in Sydney.
