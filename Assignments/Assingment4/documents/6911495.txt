Title: Warrington Borough Council elections

Warrington Borough Council elections are held every four years. Warrington Borough Council is the local authority for the unitary authority of Warrington in Cheshire, England. Since the last boundary changes in 2016, 58 councillors have been elected from 22 wards.

==Political control==
From 1900 to 1974 the town of Warrington was a county borough, independent from any county council, although treated as part of Lancashire for ceremonial purposes. Under the Local Government Act 1972 it had its territory enlarged and became a non-metropolitan district in Cheshire, with Cheshire County Council providing county-level services. The first election to the reconstituted borough council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1998 Warrington became a unitary authority, becoming independent from Cheshire County Council. Political control of Warrington since 1974 has been held by the following parties:
