Weekly during the season, the Ice Theatre of New York ensemble gathers for Choreography Labs where they work with established and emerging choreographers. As funds permit, ITNY arranges two-week residencies in other cities where ice rental is less expensive, such as Lake Placid, NY, or Sun Valley, ID, in order to develop new choreography and the dance artistry and athleticism of the ensemble.

Aerial artists such as Elisa Angeli, Joel Dear, and Sally Jeanne Watkins have combined dancing on ice with circus arts in spectacular Ice Theatre of New York performances.

In a format developed by Olympic Champion John Curry as a class for his skating company, skaters in the group’s weekly Master Edge Class focus on ensemble movement to music. This class functions much like the ballet barre in Ballet. In service to the community of skaters, this class is free to all adult skaters. Junior skaters are provided twice weekly summer classes.

Ice Theatre of New York’s educational outreach extends to New York City public school children, K-12. Their New Works and Young Artists Series gives arts exposure to students from neighborhoods in Upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Students view a performance that includes the professional company and several junior skaters followed by a one hour ice skating lesson. Programming takes place at several public rinks around the city, for a total of 10-12 sessions for 2,600-plus students.

The company provides ticketed home season performances at Chelsea Piers Sky Rink each year as well as free performances at Rockefeller Center and Riverbank State Park (Harlem); and other venues.

Ice Theatre of New York is available for performances at special events at the area rinks or in event spaces on a synthetic ice surface, which the company owns and can easily be installed in under an hour.
