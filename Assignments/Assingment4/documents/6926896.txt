==Origin of name==
Captain Steve is named after Captain Steve Thompson, the head of the Louisville Police Department's criminal investigation division in 1997.  After attending the 1997 Kentucky Derby, owner Michael E. Pegram received a birthday present from his girlfriend.  He didn't unwrap the present, which contained a gun, prior to attempting to clear security at the Louisville International Airport the day after the Derby and  police arrested Pegram for possession of a .357 Magnum.  Pegram's best friend, trainer Bob Baffert, winner of the Kentucky Derby the previous day with Silver Charm, called the Louisville Police Department and spoke with Captain Thompson.  After listening to Baffert's story, Captain Thompson intervened with the presiding judge, drove to the police station and picked up Pegram.  When the 1997 chestnut son of Fly So Free came along, Pegram is reported as saying, "I want to name him Captain Steve, after my savior."

==Death==

Captain Steve died on April 21, 2013, at Schichinohe Stallion Station in northern Japan from acute heart failure.  He was 16.
