==Origin of the name==
The name Cheeranchira is believed to have its roots in perhaps the land's original ownership by an individual named Cheeran. From Cheeran's chira (small parcel of land mostly surrounded by water) the land got its name Cheeran is an archaic Malayali name.
Another speculation is that the locality was infested by thorny amaranths (Amaranthus spinosus) plants (മുള്ളഞ്ചീര) giving it the name Cheera-chira, which later became Cheeranchira. 
The land is also referred to as Veroor Muriyil by various legal documents of the previous decades.Chev. K.K. Kurian. നാലുന്നാക്കൽ പള്ളിയും ദേശത്തിന്റെ കഥകളും.Chap. ചീരഞ്ചിറ ഗ്രാമം. Mor Adai Study Center. 2014
