==History==
Whittier Christian High School opened on September 15, 1958, though planning for the school began only nine months earlier on January 4, 1958. WCHS welcomed forty-four 9th and 10th grade students to the College Avenue Church of the Nazarene facilities. By October 1975, the student body had grown to 380 high school students, and Whittier Christian moved to the Grovedale Elementary campus in East Whittier. In 1979, the school leased the Maybrook campus to serve the freshmen students. It was 1981 when the tenth-twelfth grade students moved to the current campus in La Habra.
