Title: Alyssoides


Alyssoides is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae containing a single species, Alyssoides utriculata. A herbaceous perennial plant native to Southern Europe and Turkey, it grows on dry rocky slopes and on calcareous rocks, reaching heights of 20 to 50cm and blooming with yellow flowers between April and May–July. [A. graeca and A. bulgarica.]

The genus formerly contained a second species, Alyssoides cretica, but after molecular phylogenetic studies from 2008 and 2013 it was reassigned to the genus Lutzia.

There are two subspecies: the A. utricalata subsp. utriculata, and A. utriculata subsp. bulgarica, which characteristically differ by the pattern and shape of their hairs.

Alyssoides utriculata is used as an ornamental plant and in gardening may be referred to as inflated bladderseed  or as (Greek) bladderpod See also entries at AlyBase and BrassiBase (accessed 28 December 2021). (not to be confused with other plants named bladderpod).
