Title: Jimmy Gardner (boxer)

Jimmy Gardner (December 25, 1885 in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, Ireland â€“ May 1964) was an Irish boxer in America from 1901 to 1917. Jimmy was the brother of George Gardner, once Light Heavyweight Champion, and Billy Gardner, a boxer as well. He was known as a clever fighter, rather than a power-hitter and only lost four fights in his first eight years. Gardner recorded 61 wins, 36 by knockout, and 8 losses.

Gardner's brother-in-law, Joe Thomas was a middleweight of the teens.
