Title: List of usurpers

The following is a list of usurpers – illegitimate or controversial claimants to the throne in a monarchy. The word usurper is a derogatory term, and as such not easily definable, as the person seizing power normally will try to legitimise his position, while denigrating that of his predecessor.

|Leopold I of Belgium
|William I of the Netherlands
|1831–1865
|The southern provinces of the Netherlands declared independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands with Leopold I being proclaimed King and sovereign ruler of the newly established Kingdom of Belgium in 1831. King William I of the Netherlands refused to accept the illegal separation of Belgium and launched the Ten Days' Campaign, a large military offensive by the Dutch to recapture the renegade southern provinces. Although initially successful for the Dutch, the French however backed the Belgians militarily and thereby forced the Dutch to accept diplomatic mediation. In 1839, the two countries signed the Treaty of London, officially recognizing the Kingdom of Belgium as an independent and sovereign state, and Leopold I as its legitimate ruler.

|William I
|Harold Godwinson
|1066–1087
| When Edward the Confessor died, Harold crowned himself Harold II; William then invaded England with his own army. William's army was victorious at the Battle of Hastings, during which Harold II was killed. William then crowned himself King of England.
|-
|Stephen
|Henry I
|1135–1154
|Henry I named his daughter Matilda his heir, and she was recognised as such by the barons of England. On Henry's death, Stephen took the crown before Matilda learned that her father was dead, which led to 20 years of civil war.
|-
|Henry IV
|Richard II
|1399–1413
|A period of crisis emerged in 13981399 under Richard II as he enacted revenge on leading nobles for a dispute ten years previously. He took action against the Lords Appellant, murdering a leader and banishing Henry Bolingbrooke. On the death of Bolingbrooke's father, John of Gaunt, the son wished to return to claim his inheritance as the Duke of Lancaster, which Richard II denied. Henry returned from his exile in France whilst Richard II was away in Ireland. With the support of prominent Northern noble families, Henry took the throne.
|-
|Edward IV
|Henry VI
|1461–1470
1471–1483
| After the death of his father, Richard of York at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, Edward took over leadership of the Yorkist faction.  His father had been declared the king's heir by parliament, but Edward took the further step of proclaiming himself king in March 1461.  He subsequently defeated Lancastrian forces at the Battle of Towton, forcing Henry VI into exile in Scotland.  
|-
|Richard III
|Edward V
|1483–1485
| When his brother King Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Arrangements were made for Edward's coronation on 22 June 1483; but, before the young king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid, making their children officially illegitimate and thus barring them from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of Lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard the rightful king.
|-
|Henry VII
|Richard III
|1485–1509
| Forces under Henry Tudor won the Battle of Bosworth Field, during which Richard III was killed. Henry then became Henry VII and married the daughter of Edward IV, which is claimed to have ended the War of the Roses, though relatives of Richard made various attempts to remove him from power.

|Pepin the Short
|Childeric III
|751–768
|-The Merovingian royal family have a junior cadet branch surviving today in the neighbourhood of Whitby North Yorkshire. Two Merovingian Princes visited Whitby during the synod of Whitby in 664. Some members of the family living in the neighbourhood of Whitby are directly descended in the male line from Clovis the Frank and therefore under the Salic Law have a claim to the ancient thrones of the Frankish Kingdoms. This is the only branch of the family known to survive in the pure male line, after nearly all the Merovingians living in France were murdered by Pepin de Herstal, Charlemagne's great-grandfather. Only one male member of the North Yorkshire branch of the family is known to have the traditional family birthmark in the shape of a fleur de lis.

This very act precipitated the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), which continued on through and resulted into the Seven Years' War (1756–1763).

Although, in retrospection he can be considered founder and first Shah of the Zand dynasty.

Later on, both sons Mohammad Ali Khan and Abol-Fath Khan Zand were declared co-shahs, but they were only puppet rulers with nominal power; the real power was taken into the hands of their uncle Zaki Khan who was the de facto ruler.

|With the "Act of Abjuration" (Plakkaat van Verlatinghe) during the Dutch Revolt, the northern provinces of the Netherlands declared them-self independent from the rule of King Philip II of Spain, who also was Lord of the Netherlands. Prince William I of Orange, leader of the Dutch Revolt, was proclaimed Stadtholder (thereby de facto ruler) of the renegade Netherlands in 1572. This intensified the Eighty Years' War in which Philip II deployed his armies and tried to regain control over most of these provinces. William of Orange was assassinated in 1584 by Balthasar Gérard, a loyalist to Philip II.
