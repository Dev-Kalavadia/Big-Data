Title: Johnny Lodden



Johnny Lodden (born 1 June 1985 in Jørpeland, Norway) is a Norwegian professional poker player prominently known for his online success. He frequently played under the alias "bad_ip" on Prima network online high-stakes games (up to $40,000 buy-in NLHE), and for a brief time he was considered the biggest winner in the largest online cash games in the world (before Full Tilt Poker expanded to include larger games). Lodden has also been known to occasionally play on PokerStars under the alias "Lars-Magne".
In August 2007 Lodden gave a brief interview with the Danish poker journal Acemag, where he admitted to having lost his whole bankroll and had to retire his old bad_ip account and start from scratch with a stake from a friend.Johnny Lodden: I lost it all (in danish only)

== Lodden Thinks ==
Lodden's name is associated with the game "Lodden Thinks" in which two bettors place bets on what a third party thinks is the answer to a given question. For example, the third party will be asked how old he thinks a particular person is or how much a particular item costs, and before revealing his answer the two players will place a bet on what they think the third party's answer will be. The actual answer to the question is irrelevant. This game was invented during the World Series of Poker Europe when Phil Laak and Antonio Esfandiari played the game, with Johnny Lodden as the third party.
