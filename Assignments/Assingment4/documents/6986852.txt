Title: The House Show


The House Show (2004) is a live album from singer-songwriter Derek Webb from his House Show tour, following the release of his first solo album, She Must and Shall Go Free.

==Background==

To provide further interaction with listeners, Webb embarked on the House Show Tour, in which he literally played his concerts in people's houses. That interaction can be heard clearly on The House Show, as nearly every other track is simply Webb speaking about the meaning behind his songs.

As Webb commented in the album liner notes, "For better or for worse, [She Must and Shall Go Free] wasn't an album best suited to big stage production. The songs are more simple than showy, and they have sparked discussion in some unlikely places...Since March 2003, I have played hundreds of these concerts or 'HOUSE SHOWS' – fifty or so people in someone's living room. Just songs and conversations with no production, no press."Derek Webb, "The House Show" (liner notes) INO Records, 2004
