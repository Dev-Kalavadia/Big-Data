Title: Cebu IT Park


The Cebu IT Park (formerly known as Asiatown IT Park) is a  business park in Cebu City, Philippines. The park is envisioned to attract locators in the information technology industry. It is developed by Cebu Property Ventures and Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Cebu Holdings, Inc., in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ayala Land.

==History==
The site of where the Cebu IT Park is on used to be the site of the old Lahug Airport, which opened on 1938 before suspending operations in 1966, when Cebu's airport was transferred to the island of Mactan. One event of historical note occurred on February 19, 1981, when Pope John Paul held an open-air Papal Mass on the airport's runway.

The airport was finally closed in the mid-1990s, after it was acquired by Cebu Property Ventures, Inc., a subsidiary of  Philippine property developer Ayala Land, just a couple of years after the same developer acquired the nearby Club Filipino golf course (which would later become the site of the Cebu Business Park). It was approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) board as an economic zone on April 6, 2000. On February 27, 2001, Presidential Proclamation No. 12 made it an Information Technology Special Economic Zone.

Construction on eOffice One, the first office modules in Cebu IT Park, began in 2001 and opened in 2002.http://www.cebuholdings.com/images/milestone.jpg It was later closed down and demolished.
