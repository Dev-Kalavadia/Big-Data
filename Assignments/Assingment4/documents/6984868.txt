After the British capture of Louisbourg, its defensive fortifications were destroyed. During the 1960s and 1970s, one-quarter of the historic settlement was rebuilt in a reconstruction project by the Government of Canada, including portions of its defensive walls.
|-

During its period of existence, the town was surrounded on at least two sides by a ditch, rampart and palisade, with bastions on the corners. Eventually, though, the town was destroyed by the French during the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. In the late 1980s, an archaeological excavation began on the site and has since uncovered the remains of several buildings, the ditch, a cobblestone street and many other features.
|-
|Kahnawake, Quebec
|Demolished
|120px
|A fort in Kahnawake was constructed by Jesuit Missionaries in 1725 to protect their mission and the adjacent Iroquois village. A mission fort, Fort Du Sault-Saint-Louis, had four bastions, built of stone with bartizans on the tips. The village was enclosed on all sides by a palisade wall (rebuilt in stone in 1747), consisting of six bastions and one half-bastion. Three large gates pierced the village walls, as well as one small gate and three postern gates. The St. Francis Xavier Mission now occupies the site of the fort, and parts of the walls remain in that area.

The first major fortification in Famagusta was the Othello Tower, which was built by the Lusignans in the 14th century and was later modified by the Venetians. The latter also built city walls in the 15th and 16th centuries, and they remain intact today.

The first fortifications in Nicosia were built in the 13th and 14th century. The Venetians demolished the medieval fortifications and replaced them with a circular bastioned enceinte in the late 1560s. The walls remain largely intact except for some breaches.
|-
|Kyrenia
|The remains include some stretches of wall, three towers and a town gate. The Castle is Intact.
|
|
The first major fortification in Kyrenia was the Kyrenia Castle, which was built by the Bizantin era. In the 14th century the Lusignans modified the Castle and also built the city walls. Most of the walls were demolished in 1570 after the surrender of the city to the Turks after the fall of Nicosia. Because Famagusta was still resisting, the Turks demolished much of the walls for fear of revolt or attack by the Venetians and the Great Christian Armada. They only kept the towers of the walls for better coverage and the castle.

===Turkey===

* Troy. The ancient city of Troy was famous for its defensive walls. There is archaeological evidence that Troy VII, generally identified as the stage of the legendary Trojan War of Homer's Iliad, usually dated between 1194 BC – 1184 BC, had walls with a carefully built stone base over four meters thick and some nine meters high in places, which was surmounted by a larger superstructure with towers in mudbrick. The walls in Homer's epic are so mighty that the siege of Troy by Achaeans lasts more than nine years, and only could be finished with the trickery of the Trojan Horse. Sections of the stone base of Trojan walls still survive on the archaeological site in present-day Hisarlık, in Çanakkale Province.
* Istanbul. The system of walls around (as it was then known) Constantinople built in 412 by the Roman emperor Theodosius II was a complex stone barrier that stretched 6.5 kilometers and is often called the Wall of Theodosius. This barrier stood impregnable for ten centuries and resisted several violent sieges until 1453 when the Ottomans succeeded in breaching the walls. There was a new element in the battlefield: the Ottoman army had powder cannon and the walls offered limited resistance to them.



* Diyarbakır. Diyarbakır is surrounded by an almost intact, dramatic set of high walls of black basalt forming a  circle around the old city. There are four gates into the old city and 82 watch-towers on the walls, which were built in antiquity, restored and extended by the Roman emperor Constantius in 349.

Other walls surrounding the centre of Durham survive between the River Wear, and the houses lining a number of thoroughfares: Sadler Street, North Bailey, South Bailey, and Palace Green. The street names North Bailey and South Bailey are testament to this fact.
