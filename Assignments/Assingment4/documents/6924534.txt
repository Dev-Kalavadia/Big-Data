Title: George of NaplesGeorge (died 739) was the duke of Naples for a decade beginning in 729. 

George succeeded Theodore I and continued his prudent policy of balancing between the Byzantine Empire and the papacy, at that time embroiled in a conflict over the iconoclastic controversy. He was succeeded by Gregory I.

An ancient monument, dedicated to George, can be found to this day at Terracina.
