===Juniors===
Garner played three NHL games in his career, for the Calgary Flames in 1998–99 as an emergency callup from his junior team, the Oshawa Generals.  He posted a 0–2–0 record with a 5.18 GAA before being returned to the Generals where he was named to the Ontario Hockey League's second All-Star Team in 1999.

===Professional===
Garner spent most of his North American career in the ECHL before moving to play in Europe in 2003.  He was named the co-winner of the ECHL's playoff Most Valuable player award in 2002 while a member of the Greenville Grrrowl.

While playing in Norway during the 2005–06 season, Garner suffered a horrible groin injury which ripped the muscles from the bone. Doctors told him that under no circumstances could Garner play as a goaltender for at least one year. So he skated as a forward with the Southern Professional Hockey League's Jacksonville Barracudas, where he scored 12 goals and 22 points in 47 games. He remained with the Barracudas during the 2007-08 SPHL season, where he scored 12 goals and 27 points in 41 games.

Garner also played as a forward with the Brantford Blast of Major League Hockey during the 2008-09 OHA Sr League season, where he scored 11 points in 13 games.
