==Musical career==
As a teenager Porter began to write his own songs, recording and distributing hundreds of homemade cassettes of wildly varying disposition and sound quality, both on his own and as a member of the hardcore art-punk band Neglected Lawn.  Porter's records began to appear internationally after he signed to Camera Obscura, an Australian indie label who released his first proper full-length CD: Reverb Saved My Life (2002) as well as the disc Reconsidered (2001) by shoegazer band Phineas Gage, of which he was a short-term member.

After moving to New York in 2003, Porter recorded a handful of discs:Lisha Kill (Camera Obscura, 2005),Aural Innovations - review of Lisha Kill Maybe Waltz (Evelyn Records, 2004), and Skylan Mo (Asaurus Records, 2004).

In 2006 Porter signed with Greyday Records, an indie label in Portland Oregon, who released the Die Wandaland LP, in September 2006.  The label is also releasing, as two double CDs, the bulk of Porter's work from 2008, a year in which Porter recorded three full-length CDs (A Swan At Smiley's; Cry Me A River, Sing Me A Raft; and Goodbye Pork Pie Heart) as well as an EP (Darlene Evening USA).  The first of these discs, combining A Swan At Smiley's and Cry Me A River, Sing Me A Raft was released in April, 2009.

==Poetry==
Porter is also a poet and novelist.  His first book of poetry, The Intrusive Ache of Morning, was published in 2001 by Chicago's Press of the Third Mind.  His second, Nervous Halo, was published a year later on the late Paul Dilsaver's Arts and Academic Press.  He has also written two novels, Kristallnacht (2001), and Apocalypse Later (2006),Camera Obscura Records - biography  as well as a book of short stories called Hemm Haww (2009).
