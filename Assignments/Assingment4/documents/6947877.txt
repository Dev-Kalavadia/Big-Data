Title: Functional structuralism

Functional structuralism is a spin-off from systems theory in sociology. Systems theory, following Talcott Parsons, began as a structural-functionalist theory, that is, social structures were stressed and placed at the center of analysis, and social functions were deduced from these structures. In functional-structuralist theory, in contrast, the initial focus is on the function of an aspect of society, and only after functions have been specified are enabling structures designated.
