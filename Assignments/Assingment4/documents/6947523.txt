The Cadeby Light Railway was a  narrow-gauge railway in the garden of the rectory in Cadeby, Leicestershire.

In the early 1960s the Reverend Teddy Boston became rector of All Saints' Church, Cadeby. Boston was a lifelong railway enthusiast and wanted to build a miniature railway in his new garden, but the cost proved prohibitive. Instead he searched for a full-sized narrow-gauge locomotive. 

In 1962, he purchased Pixie, a W.G. Bagnall  from the Cranford quarry. The quarry owners donated a short length of track and two wagons and the Cadeby Light Railway was opened.https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/people/cp32883/cadeby-light-railway

Over the years, Boston built an extensive collection of ex-industrial narrow-gauge rolling stock which ran on the extremely short line in his garden. He also maintained an extensive OO gauge model railway at Cadeby.

Although Boston died in 1986, his widow, Audrey kept the railway open for nearly twenty years, holding regular open days. 

The railway finally closed in May 2005.https://rcts.org.uk/a-little-history-of-the-cadeby-light-railway/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-little-history-of-the-cadeby-light-railway The majority of the collection has been amalgamated with the Moseley Railway Trust at the Apedale Community Country Park.https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/people/cp32883/cadeby-light-railway As of 2014, Pixie was undergoing restoration.
