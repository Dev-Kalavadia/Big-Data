Title: Handle the Jandal
Handle the Jandal was an annual New Zealand awards ceremony that celebrated self-produced New Zealand music videos. Formally known as the Radio Active 89FM Handle the Jandal DIY New Zealand Music Video Awards, the competition was open to music videos of New Zealand music, made by New Zealand filmmakers with no external funding assistance.

==History==

Handle the Jandal was founded in 1997 by Dave Gibbons, manager of Wellington alternative radio station Radio Active. It grew from a local event to a nationally significant competition, attracting entries from around New Zealand.

Handle the Jandal was initially held at the Paramount Theatre but from 2004 it relocated to the Embassy Theatre, both in central Wellington.

Previous winners who have gone on to prominent careers both in New Zealand and on the international scene include James Barr, Chris Graham, Aaron Beck and Rollo Wenlock, who shot a music video for electronic band The Prodigy.

==Competition details==

A panel of preliminary judges whittled down the entrants for the Handle the Jandal competition to 15 finalists. Once the finalists had been decided, appointments were made for the final judging panel. Judges included prominent New Zealand personalities and film-makers, such as Chris Graham and Taika Waititi. The judging panel decided all but one of the award categories. The Favourite Handle the Jandal Video winner and two runners-up were decided by audience vote.

The Golden Jandal was the award given to winners at the Handle the Jandal award ceremonies.
