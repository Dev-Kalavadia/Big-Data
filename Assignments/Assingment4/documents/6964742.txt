Title: Let's Get Married (Jagged Edge song)

"Let's Get Married" is a song by American contemporary R&B group Jagged Edge from their second studio album, J.E. Heartbreak (1999). Released on April 11, 2000, the song spent three weeks atop the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart in 2000 and reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001, the song was issued in Australia as a double A-side with "Promise" and reached number two on the Australian Singles Chart. The music video (directed by Tim Story) features Fredro Starr and Kent Masters-King as the fictional couple deciding on whether they should get married or not.

The song's official remix features DJ Run of Run-D.M.C. and samples the group's debut single "It's Like That". The official video for the remix was directed by Bryan Barber. The group performed the single at the kayfabe wedding of Theodore Long and Kristal Marshall on the September 21, 2007, episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. Another "Reception" remix was produced by Kanye West and samples Hall & Oates' song "Grounds for Separation".
