The band was founded by guitarist Zippy Caplan and bassist Woody Woodrich.(29 October 2001). Monster Tracks, Star Tribune  The band was very popular in Minnesota, mostly due to Caplan's fame playing with The Litter. The manager of radio station KDWB mistook the single "Of Paupers and Poets" for a song by Cream, giving valuable early airtime to the band.   They also would perform a cover of the William Tell Overture.(30 May 1970). Talent in Action, Billboard (magazine)

Eventually, the band broke up due to musical differences, especially between Woodrich and Caplan.
