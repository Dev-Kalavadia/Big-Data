Title: Radmind

Radmind is a suite of Unix command-line tools and an application server designed to remotely administer the file systems of multiple client machines.

For Mac OS X, there is a graphical user interface called Radmind Assistant, as well as a GUI for the Radmind server called Radmind Server Manager.

Radmind was the 2003 Apple Design Awards runner-up for Best Mac OS X Server Solution.

Radmind is developed by the Research Systems Unix Group at the University of Michigan.

== How Radmind Works ==
Radmind operates as a tripwire, detecting changes in a client's filesystem (and, in the case of Microsoft Windows, the registry) and reversing the changes. Radmind stores filesystem specifications in text files called transcripts, signified with a .T extension.  Transcripts are referenced from command files, signified with a .K extension, which specify which transcripts (and with what precedence) should be applied to a client machine's filesystem.

== Suite of tools ==
The radmind suite of tools comprises

* ktcheck, which updates the locally stored command files and transcripts to match those on the server.
* fsdiff, which checks the client filesystem against the transcripts on the local system without using network bandwidth.
* lapply, which updates the client filesystem to match the transcripts, downloading files as needed.
* lcreate, which uploads new transcripts to the server.
* lcksum, which verifies uploaded transcripts.
* lfdiff, which compares local files with copies on Radmind server.
* lmerge, which combines transcripts on the server.
* ra.sh , which automates the update process using ktcheck, fsdiff, and lapply.
* twhich, which returns which transcript(s) a file is referenced in.
* applefile, which allows Radmind to work with AppleSingle files.
