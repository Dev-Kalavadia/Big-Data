Title: Generative systems
Generative systems are technologies with the overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences. When generative systems provide a common platform, changes may occur at varying layers (physical, network, application, content) and provide a means through which different firms and individuals may cooperate indirectly and contribute to innovation.

Depending on the rules, the patterns can be extremely varied and unpredictable.  One of the better-known examples is Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. Other examples include Boids and Wikipedia. More examples can be found in generative music, generative art, and, more recently, in video games such as Spore.

=== Jonathan Zittrain ===
In 2006, Jonathan Zittrain published The Generative Internet in Volume 119 of the Harvard Law Review. In this paper, Zittrain describes a technology's degree of generativity as being the function of four characteristics:

* Capacity for leverage – the extent to which an object enables something to be accomplished that would not have otherwise be possible or worthwhile.
* Adaptability – how widely a technology can be used without it needing to be modified.
* Ease of mastery – how much effort and skill is required for people to take advantage of the technology's leverage.
* Accessibility – how easily people are able to start using a technology.
