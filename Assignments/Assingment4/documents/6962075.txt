Title: Ruedi Aebersold


Rudolf Aebersold (better known as Ruedi Aebersold born September 12, 1954 ) is a Swiss biologist, regarded as a pioneer in the fields of proteomics and systems biology. He has primarily researched techniques for measuring proteins in complex samples, in many cases via mass spectrometry. Ruedi Aebersold is a professor of Systems biology at the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology (IMSB) in ETH Zurich. He was one of the founders of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, where he previously had a research group.

Ruedi Aebersold is known for the development and application of targeted proteomics techniques in the field of biomedical research, in order to understand the function, interaction and localization of each protein in the cell and its changes in disease states. To this end, Ruedi Abersold has made significant contributions in the development and application of targeted proteomics methods, including selected reaction monitoring and data-independent acquisition. Ruedi Aebersold is also recognized for its contributions in the development of standard formats and open source software for the analysis and storage of mass spectrometry and proteomics data, and he is one of the inventors of the Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT) technique for quantitative proteomics, a technique that measures the relative quantities of proteins between two sample by using tags containing stable isotopes of different masses.

He is co-founder and scientific advisor of the companies ProteoMediX and Biognosys.
