Title: Brusino Arsizio
Brusino Arsizio is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland on the Lake of Lugano.

==History==
The village has been inhabited since the Roman era.  In 1970, a plundered Roman grave was found with grave goods.  The modern municipality of Brusino Arsizio is first mentioned in 1167 as Bruxia.

In the 8th Century the Totoniden family of Campione d'Italia possessed land in the village.  Around 1227, the monastery of S. Ambrogio in Milan acquired property.   They built a tower or other fortification to help support the fortifications of Campione.  In 1671 it was mentioned as Castrum Brugini Arsitii.

The parish church of San Michele, which was built during the era of the Lombard kings, broke away in 1508 from the mother church of Riva San Vitale.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the activity of the population were linked with small cultivation, fishing and  the cut of wood that was afterward brought to Lugano by boat and then sold at the local market. From the second half of the 19th century innovations were brought to Brusino. In 1875, the street that linked Brusino with Riva San Vitale was built, and then, in 1906 the street that linked Brusino with Porto Ceresio (Italy) was also finished.

In 1910 the drinking water was available in Brusino, and in 1914 also the electricity. From the post-war period, with the beginning of the mass tourism, hotel business started to become really important in this village (in 1958 the overnight stayings reached its climax with 33700 stayings). Nowadays Brusino is still a touristic village with almost 50% of the houses that are second-residence for tourist.
