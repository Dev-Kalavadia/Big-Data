Title: Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow



Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow is a 7" extended play released in March 1980 by Australian Punk band The Saints. It was produced by the group's singer-guitarist, Chris Bailey using the pseudonym L. Lambert. It is their first release after founding guitarist, Ed Kuepper, had left the band. The Saints line-up for the EP was Chris Bailey on lead vocals and guitar; C. Barrington on guitar; Cub Calloway on guitar; Ivor Hay on drums; and Janine Hall on bass guitar. A 12" version with an additional track, "Miss Wonderful", was issued on the French label, New Rose.

== Reception ==

Clinton Walker described Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow as, "shambolic in the extreme, but still possessed of a certain spark." Australian musician, Paul Kelly remembered that he had "cottoned onto The Saints around the time of Prehistoric Sounds, their third album. Paralytic Tonight is a four track EP that came not long after. I played it over and over again in a flat on Punt Road. This was their great middle period." AllMusic's Mark Deming rated it as three-and-a-half stars out of five and explained, "While these four songs (or five, depending on which version you buy) are tougher and more rock-oriented than the albums that would soon follow from Bailey's edition of the group, they're still a far cry from the breakneck fury of (I'm) Stranded or Eternally Yours."
