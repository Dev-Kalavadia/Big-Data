==Biography==

Johann von Dalberg was born in 1445, the son of Wolfgang von Dalberg. He studied at Erfurt and in Italy, where he took his degree of doctor utriusque juris at the University of Ferrara and devoted himself more especially to the study of Greek.

Returning to Germany, he became privy councillor to Philip, Elector Palatine, whom he assisted in bringing the University of Heidelberg to the height of its fame. He was instrumental in founding the first chair of Greek, which was filled by his friend Rudolphus Agricola, and he also established the university library and a college for students of civil law. He was an ardent humanist, was president of the Sodalitas Celtica founded by the poet Konrad Celtes, and corresponded with many of the leading scholars of his day, to whom he showed himself a veritable Maecenas. He was employed also on various diplomatic missions by the emperor and the elector.

He became Prince-Bishop of Worms in 1482 and died on 28 July 1503.Profile on catholic-hierarchy.org
