Title: The Clarks (album)

The Clarks is a 1991 eponymous second album by Pittsburgh band The Clarks. Like their debut album,  it was an independent release, but the album quickly gained a cult following in Western Pennsylvania and became a popular album in Pittsburgh. When WDVE, Pittsburgh's largest rock station, began playing "Penny on the Floor," the band achieved instant local fame.  It was actually surprising at the time that radio stations would pick up "Penny On the Floor", a mandolin-driven song, as opposed to one of the band's more up tempo rock songs.
