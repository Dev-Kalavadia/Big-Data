==History==

Teekay Petrojarl started off as Golar Nor Offshore and was part of Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) in 1998 when it acquired Golar-Nor and two FPSO vessels, Petrojarl I and Petrojarl Foinaven. Within a year two more vessels were delivered Petrojarl Banff and Petrojarl Varg. In 2005 the company acquired the shuttle tanker Rita Knutsen with possibilities for FPSO conversion. In 2007, the Russian tanker Che Guevara was converted into FPSO Petrojarl Cidade de Rio das Ostras by the Polish Remontowa S.A.

Petrojarl ASA was demerged from Petroleum Geo-Services in 2006 and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange in June. Teekay acquired majority ownership in December and Petrojarl ASA became Teekay Petrojarl ASA.
