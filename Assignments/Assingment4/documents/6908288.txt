The hospital was founded by the Daughters of Charity religious order and incorporated on May 19, 1903.About Us: History ,  St. Vincent's Medical Center (accessed March 27, 2015). Its first building had 75 beds and was built at a cost of $250,000.  It opened its doors on June 28, 1905; more than 70 patients were treated by the end of that first day.

On Easter Sunday, April 17, 1976, a new hospital building opened just behind the original one. That day, William J. Riordan, then president and chief executive officer of the hospital, directed the transfer of 209 patients to the new structure, a  building nearly twice the size of the old one.

When the move was made to the new building, the hospital's name was changed from St. Vincent's Hospital to St. Vincent's Medical Center.
