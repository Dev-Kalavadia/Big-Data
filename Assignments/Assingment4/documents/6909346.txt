Title: Minnesota Fight"Minnesota Fight" is one of several school songs of the University of Minnesota.  Responding to a 1925 contest to find an additional fight song for the school, university graduate Truman E. Rickard entered a piece entitled "Minnesota! Let's Go!".  Rickard shared the contest's hundred-dollar prize with another entry, Marion Bassett's "Our Minnesota".  Rickard's fight song can still be heard at Minnesota Golden Gopher athletic events, but is now known as "Minnesota Fight".
