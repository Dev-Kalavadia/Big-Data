The tour promoted a World Championship, an International Championship and a Tag Team Championship. i-Generation performed one tour of Australia. One event was filmed and broadcast as a pay-per-view event, later released on video. The show featured Dennis Rodman in the main event, and was advertised as Rodman Down Under.

==Superstars of Wrestling==
Superstars of Wrestling was a pay-per-view event held by i-Generation. It took place on July 30, 2000 (and aired in the United States on December 1, 2000) from the Sydney SuperDome in Sydney, Australia. With the subtitle "Rodman Down Under", it was promoted largely for its main event which pitted the scientific veteran Curt Hennig against the controversial NBA star Dennis Rodman.

Vince Mancini and Ted DiBiase provided commentating for the event. Between each match, a female dance team known as the i-Generettes (similar to the Nitro Girls) performed at the entry way.
