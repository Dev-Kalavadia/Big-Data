The Old Norse name of the Arctic Sea was Dumbshaf . This sea (haf) was named after the mountain Dumbr  (an old form of Domen). The name is probably related to the English word dumb, but in what meaning is unclear.

==History and folklore==
Domen is often associated with the witch trials in Finnmark during the 17th century. Vardø was the site of approximately 70 witch trials between 1601 and 1663. This was a large number, since there were only a couple of hundred inhabitants in the area at that time.

According to folklore, Vardø and Domen became infamous as the end of the world, Ultima Thule and the entrance to Hell was said to be somewhere around Domen or Vardø, and so witches flew to Domen to meet the devil for sabbath.
