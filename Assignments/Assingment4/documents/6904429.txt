Title: Clay High School (Oregon, Ohio)
Clay High School is a public high school in Oregon, Ohio, United States, east of Toledo. It is the only high school in the Oregon City School District.  The school is named for Jeremiah Clay, who donated his farmland for the school to be built on.

Over the last few years the Clay High School Campus has undergone remodeling. An addition was made to the main building, while the old elementary and the Annex were demolished. The Main building also was gutted and redone.

The school colors are green and yellow. Their nickname is the Eagles, after their mascots Eddy and Edna the Eagle. Clay was a member of the Great Lakes League until 2003 when they joined the Toledo City League. Clay's joining of the TCL made them the second non-Toledo team to join the league (Cardinal Stritch 1971-1994) though they have played the Toledo City League schools for years prior to joining.  In 2011, Clay joined the newly formed Three Rivers Athletic Conference as a charter member.

===Marching, Concert, and Symphonic Band===
The modern band program at Clay was started by Clay graduate and saxophonist Nancy Fox Bricker in 1952, cementing the band as a marching band known as the Clay High School Fighting Eagle Marching Band. After Mrs. Bricker became ill and her husband assumed directing duties, Clay graduate Charles Neal was made the new director in 1967. The traditions of the Clay band were continued and expanded by its next director, Clay graduate Brian Gyuras, who was named the new director in 1999 and brought back student direction of the band. The current director of the band is Joseph Kuzdzal, who has held the position since 2019.

The band performs at Clay football games, and during the off season performs concerts and other parades. The band is split into two sections based on grade level, the concert band for freshmen and sophomores, and the symphonic band for juniors and seniors. The band also has multiple subgroups, in the form of jazz band and pep band. The band also claims the largest Alumni band in Ohio, which performs every other year during the homecoming football game.

===Concert Chorale===
Clay High School includes a choir program in the form of Concert Chorale. The program educates students in various subjects of good musicianship, and contributes to an enrolled student's fine arts credit needed to graduate. The program also puts on multiple concerts throughout the school year, and performs at other events. The current director of the program is Thom Sneed.

The Concert Chorale is also host to Varsity Voices, an audition based group which learns additional music outside of the school day to perform at concerts. The program also formerly had two gender based groups, a men's chorus and an all female chorus named "Bel Canto".
