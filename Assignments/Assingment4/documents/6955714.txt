Title: The Current (newspaper)
The Current is the official student newspaper of the University of Missouri–St. Louis. The Current is a tabloid published weekly on Mondays. The paper has won numerous awards, including "Best in State" from the Missouri College Media Association. Its office is located on the first floor of the Millennium Student Center on the north campus.

== History ==
The Current was preceded by the monthly Tiger Cub from 1960–63 and the bi-weekly Mizzou News from 1963–66. The newspaper's name became UMSL Current in 1966; "UMSL" was later dropped from the name. The name change was intended to foster an identity independent from the University of Missouri in Columbia. The name Current refers to the river motif associated with the student body's choice of "Riverman" as the school mascot. UMSL has since changed its mascot to the Triton.
