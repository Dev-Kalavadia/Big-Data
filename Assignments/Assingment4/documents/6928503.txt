Stilano (portrayed by Vince Colosimo) is an uptight store runner, demanding everything be in order including his drinks and food that are safe to consume – the coldest must always be at the front and preparing the food in a professional way. Spackneys (played by Stephen Curry), however is the opposite. His chips are made of dirty potatoes and he could not care less about health or safety precautions.
