===2006 Nation's Cup Results===

Despite taking only a mere six faults up to the final round, Great Britain created a jump-off situation during their final ride as their squad gained four faults to equal Canada's ten.  The competition then culminated in a thrilling jump-off between the two teams as anchor riders Michael Whitaker and Ian Millar were selected to represent their respective teams.  Despite faulting for the first time that day, it was Canada's Ian Millar riding eleven-year-old gelding In Style who ensured Canada's first victory at this tournament.  Taking the bronze was United States' national team, who rode strongly; taking only sixteen faults.  The remaining rankings saw Germany take fourth place, the Netherlands achieving fifth place, and Belgium finishing in sixth.

Despite fairly warm temperatures and windy afternoon showers, attendance at the 2006 Nation's cup final held Saturday, September 9, approximated 60 870; a single day record for Spruce Meadows.http://www.calgarysun.com (10 September 2006 )
