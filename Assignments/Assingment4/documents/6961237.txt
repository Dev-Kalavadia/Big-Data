Title: Special Actions Detachment




The Special Actions Detachment () or DAE is the special operations maritime unit of the Portuguese Navy. It is part of the Portuguese Marine Corps. Raised in 1985, the DAE is one of the smallest special forces units within the Portuguese Armed Forces. It is responsible for conducting special operations, amphibious reconnaissance, combat diving, long-range reconnaissance patrols, combat search and rescue (CSAR), maritime counter-terrorism, demolition operations, covert operations, hostage rescue, boarding operations, counter-piracy, eliminating high-valued targets, guerilla warfare and other missions in support of Portuguese and NATO armed forces. DAE's mission and training are similar to American special forces and it often trains with them.

==Organization==
The unit is led by a commander, and is subdivided into a command cell and four combat teams. The command cell contains the unit commander, his deputy (a lieutenant commander) and a small staff of eight. The combat teams are composed of ten men: petty officers and seamen and a commanding petty officer.

==Selection and training==
DAE operatives are drawn from the ranks of marines, all having high operational experience. Due to the nature of its actions, candidate acceptance is extremely restrictive and selective. Only 5–10% of the applicants manage to join the unit.

Upon completion of the basic selection phase prospective recruits then begin the first phase of their training. Phase 1 of their training is conducted at the Navy's combat diver school. Students receive instruction in: basic combat diving techniques, EOD and underwater demolitions.
Candidates who successfully complete the first phase are assigned to the DAE on a probationary status, and begin their second phase of training. Phase 2 instruction includes courses on: escape and evasion techniques, advanced driving, mountaineering, offensive operations, parachuting training and basic English. Once a trainee is permanently assigned to the DAE he will continue to receive various courses of instruction throughout his career.

After this tough selection, COEMAR starts, which lasts 18 weeks and is divided into three phases:

* Technical (7 weeks)
* Combat (3 weeks)
* Tactics (8 weeks)

During and after COEMAR, DAE's military personnel receive training in areas as varied as:

* Special operations
