==History==
Sigirino is first mentioned in 1335 as Sezelino.  In the Middle Ages, Sigirino belonged to the territory of the Carvina valley community.  Carvina included all the villages in the upper Vedeggio valley and its secular and religious capital was Bironico.  In a land register of 1296, Como Cathedral possessed lands, pastures, forests, farmland and land with houses in Sigirino.  It is likely that at that time Sigirino possessed some type of fortifications.

The Church of St. Andrew was first mentioned in 1296.  It was totally rebuilt in the 16th century and restored in the 18th.  After its separation from Bironico in 1625, Sigirino had its own parish.

Economically, the village was dominated by agriculture and emigration.  In the 21st century, it belongs to commercial and industrial zone in the valley floor between Sigirino and the neighboring villages.
