==History==

Fotosearch grew out of Publishing Perfection, founded in 1987, when electronic publishing was in its infancy. From the beginning the company targeted graphics and multimedia professionals through its monthly catalogue. The company specialized in providing the assistance required for buying graphics tools such as laser printers and image scanners. In addition to hardware and software the company began to offer high quality stock images in the early 1990s.

In 1996, Publishing Perfection launched a website offering an online catalogue, expanded product information and special discounts. In 1998, the company introduced the Fotosearch website where customers could search multiple stock photography publishers at a single site.
