Title: RK Metković

Rukometni klub Metković – Mehanika is a men's professional handball club from Metković, Croatia. It is the only club to win a domestic title and the Croatian Cup, except RK Zagreb. Due to economic difficulties the club has not competed in Croatian Handball Premier League between 2010 and 2022. 

The first club was founded on 26 September 1963 under the name Mehanika. RK Metković has changed its name several times since his foundation, so it played under the names of Razvitak, Metković Jambo, and another team Metković 1963 until reunification. 

Today, this club has men's and women's section.

==Accomplishments==
In 2000–01 season of the Croatian League, Metković and RK Zagreb tied for first place but RK Zagreb had home advantage in the finals which were not completed. Metković finished first in 2001–02 season of the Croatian League but because of a player whose transfer from RK Zagreb to Metković was not completed (it was still a case in arbitration; he played for them in a friendly match under a different name) they were moved to second place.
