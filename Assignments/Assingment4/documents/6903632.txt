==History==
The ADempiere project was created in September 2006.  Disagreement between the open-source developer community that formed around the Compiere open-source ERP From Compiere to ADempiere!  software and the project's corporate sponsor ultimately led to the creation of Adempiere as a fork of Compiere.
Within weeks of the fork, ADempiere reached the top five of the SourceForge.net rankings. This ranking provides a measure of both the size of its developer community and also its impact on the open-source ERP software market.

The project name comes from the Italian verb "adempiere", which means "fulfillment of a duty" but with the additional senses of "Complete, reach, practice, perform tasks, or release; also, give honor, respect", here which were considered appropriate to what the project aimed to achieve.
