Kahane attended the École normale supérieure and obtained the agrégation of mathematics in 1949. He then worked for the CNRS from 1949 to 1954, first as an intern and then as a research assistant. He defended his PhD in 1954; his advisor was Szolem Mandelbrojt.

He was assistant professor, then professor of mathematics in Montpellier from 1954 to 1961. Since then, he has been professor until his retirement in 1994,Kahane, Jean-Pierre.Ministerial decision of 6 April 1994 then professor emeritus at the Université de Paris-Sud in Orsay.
