Title: T. Thorn Coyle
T. Thorn Coyle (born September 24, 1965)Coyle, T. Thorn. Interview. "Thorn." Modern Pagans: An Investigation of Contemporary Pagan Practices. By John Sulak and V. Vale. San Francisco: RE/Search Publications, 2002. 62-69. is a Neopagan author and teacher from the United States of America. They practiced within the Feri and Reclaiming traditions of witchcraft before developing their own approach integrating other spiritual practices. Their writings include urban fantasy and instruction on magical spiritual practice.

== Career ==
Coyle taught witchcraft in both Feri and Reclaiming traditions. Around 2009, citing the desire to integrate other mystical perspectives and their own experience, Coyle separated their work from the Feri tradition. They founded the Morningstar Mystery School to continue their teaching.

Coyle has published several books on magic and spiritual practice that detail meditations and exercises for personal growth and empowerment. Their first book, Evolutionary Witchcraft, serves as a "magical workbook" for the Feri tradition and reflects practices they developed including "devotional dances." It also reflects the influences of Sufism, Gurdjieff, and radical Catholicism on their approach to magic. Their later books on spiritual practice include instruction on using magic to support the "Great Work" of union with the divine.

Coyle presented at the Parliament of the World's Religions in 2009 and 2015.

In 2015, they began focusing on writing fiction. Most of their novels, including the series The Panther Chronicles and The Witches of Portland, are fantasy with themes of magic and social justice. They have also contributed to magazines, blogs, and published collections.

Coyle is a singer and composer of pagan chants who has made several recordings, including two collections of seasonal chants in collaboration with Sharon Knight.

==Tattoos==
Thorn Coyle has many tattoos, and wrote this of them in 1997: "Tattoos are spiritual markers for me. When I started getting them ten years ago, it came from a need to have rites of passage that included spiritual reminders and physical markers. All my tattoos have a spiritual meaning to me, and layers of meaning that shift over time.""Thorn." Women Called to the Path of Rumi. ed. Shakina Reinhertz. Prescott, AZ: Hohm Press, 1997. 164-165. Some of Coyle's tattoos were photographed by Charles Gatewood.
