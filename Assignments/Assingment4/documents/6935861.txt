Title: Ample Destruction


Ample Destruction is the first studio album released by American power metal band Jag Panzer, released in 1984. Originally released on Azra Records, a small independent label, it received poor marketing from the label, and thus became only an underground hit amongst the metal community, and was bootlegged repeatedly.
