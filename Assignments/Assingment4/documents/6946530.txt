Title: North High School (Eastlake, Ohio)

North High School is a public high school in Eastlake, Ohio.  It is one of two high schools in the Willoughby-Eastlake City School District. The school was created when the Willoughby Union High School was split into North High School and South High School.

The old North was razed and new baseball fields and practice fields for soccer and football were built on the site.
