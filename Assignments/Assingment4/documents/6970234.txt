The Globe and Mail, January 7, 1992. the album was compiled by Grant McDonagh, who would later become one of the founders of Zulu Records."Pop's new indie dependence". The Globe and Mail, June 17, 1995. Most tracks were recorded at the Sabre Sound studio in Vancouver; for some bands, their contributions to the album were their first and/or only time recording material in a studio."Punk's big family reunion: Joe Keithley celebrates the original Vancouver Complication".

==Reissue==
The album was reissued in compact disc format in 2005, on Joe Keithley's Sudden Death Records. The CD reissue's liner notes acknowledged that the 1978 Akron, Ohio punk compilation The Akron Compilation was one of McDonagh's key inspirations for compiling and releasing the album.

The CD reissue was marked by a release party at Vancouver's Wise Hall, featuring performances by many of the bands on the compilation. In 2011, Sudden Death Records announced a special project, donating all proceeds from sales of the album during the Christmas retail season to the Vancouver Food Bank.

==Critical response==
Writing for Exclaim!, Sam Sutherland stated that "a better snapshot of the beginnings of Canada's fertile West Coast punk scene does not exist.""Various: Vancouver Complication". Exclaim!, May 1, 2005. For AllMusic, Ned Raggett noted that some of the bands on the compilation sounded derivative of the more established punk rock scenes in London and New York City, but praised other bands with "other less straitjacketed ways around punk inspirations" for producing "lasting winners", and called the overall album "a classic late-'70s punk-era city-scene survey".
