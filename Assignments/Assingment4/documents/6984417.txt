== History ==

St. Luke's School is an independent school with a history of excellence spanning seventy-five years.

Today's St. Luke's School is really the fourth school on its current grounds.  Three times over the years, the Church of St. Luke in the Fields established parish day schools, but the constantly changing neighborhoods made it difficult to sustain them.

As World War II ended and young middle-class families moved into the West Village, St. Luke's responded to the community's need for a school. With the help of Trinity Church, St. Luke's School opened its doors on September 24, 1945, with 19 children and two teachers in classrooms in the Parish House. The school operated as a division of the church until it achieved independence in 2012. In 2020, St. Luke's School fully expanded its student body after a decade of growth. In fall 2022, the school opened its brand new rooftop play field and learning space.

Past heads of school have included Katharine Taylor, Barbara Belknap, Katherine Johnson (interim), Jessie-Lea Hayes, and Ann Mellow.https://www.stlukeschool.org/who-we-are/history Robert Snyder was a legendary teacher who was at the school between 1973 and 2011.https://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/2011/06/school_honors_retiring_teacher.html Freyda Rapp was a much-admired physical education teacher from 1985 to 2012.https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1580307321/stlukes/yy8l7hwakkl1x1hw7qji/Winged_Ox_Summer_2012.pdf An influential past librarian was Grace Sawyer, after whom the current library is named.https://www.stlukeschool.org/who-we-are/history
