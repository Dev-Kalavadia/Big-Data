===Middle schools===

====Richard F. Bernotas Middle School====
Richard F. Bernotas Middle School, also referred to as Bernotas Middle School, was established in 1969. Its first name was North Junior High, but in 2002, it was dedicated to Richard F. Bernotas. There are about 1000 students in it.  Bernotas's sports teams go under the "Bernotas Vikings". Their mascot is Thor, represented by a viking. The school colors are blue and gold. Unlike the three middle schools in the district, RFB has its own unique school song, and not a rewrite of lyrics.

====Leon J. Lundahl Middle School====
Leon J. Lundahl Middle School, also referred to as Lundahl Middle School, was established in 1959 as South Junior High. The name was switched to Lundahl Middle School after the retirement of Leon J. Lundahl, the superintendent in 1966. Lundahl Middle School was the first school to be named after someone at the time.

In 1974, a new addition including a new gymnasium, learning center, locker room  area, and science complex was opened. Mr. Richard Carlstedt became principal in 1989. In 1990-91, a new north end classroom addition, cafeteria, locker room area, and second gymnasium were added to the Lundahl campus.  The school became an accredited middle school in the spring of 1995, and its name was officially changed to Lundahl Middle School Campus for the opening of the 1996-97 school year.

Lundahl's colors are purple and gold, and they compete in athletics as the Lundahl Lions, female-oriented sports teams being referred to as the Lady Lions. Lundahl's mascot is a lion, whose name is Leo. Leo comes from the name Leon J. Lundahl, the retiring superintendent in 1966.

==== Hannah Beardsley Middle School====
Hannah Beardsley Middle School opened in 1996, the most recent middle school in Crystal Lake. Its namesake, Hannah Beardsley, was the first school teacher in the Crystal Lake area. The first principal of Hannah Beardsley Middle School was Ron Ludwig.

HBMS was opened to accommodate Crystal Lake's burgeoning population, which had been fueled mostly by an influx of middle-class families from Chicago during the 1990s. When it first opened, Beardsley was already close to capacity. Rising enrollment necessitated the construction of an additional wing of classrooms on the building's upper floor, which was completed in 2000. Present enrollment is over 1100 students in grades 6 through 8. Beardsley's sports teams compete as the Beardsley Bears, and its school colors are blue and orange.
