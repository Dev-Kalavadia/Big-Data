Title: Bergen-Passaic Scholastic League
The Bergen-Passaic Scholastic League, abbreviated BPSL, was an athletic conference comprising thirteen private and public high schools located in Bergen County and Passaic County, New Jersey, United States. The conference ceased to exist following the 2009â€“10 school year and joined most of the schools from the Bergen County Scholastic League to form the North Jersey Interscholastic Conference. The only school that did not join was Paterson Catholic High School, as the school closed following the 2009-10 year.

==League sports==
The Bergen-Passaic Scholastic League allowed member schools to compete in many sports spread out among three seasons. Although the league did not have a cheerleading division, many member schools had their own cheerleading teams. Other sports, such as fencing, are offered by some schools, but like cheerleading, were not part of the BPSL.

The following is a list of the sports that BPSL offered. Some sports did not have a team from every school.
