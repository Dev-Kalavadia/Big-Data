Title: Clergy Act 1661


The Clergy Act 1661 (13 Cha. 2 St. 1. c.2) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of England passed in 1661. It "repealed, annulled and made void to all intents and purposes" the Clergy Act 1640, which had prevented those in holy orders from exercising any temporal jurisdiction or authority and so, expelled the bishops, as Lords Spiritual, from the House of Lords. It was itself repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863.
