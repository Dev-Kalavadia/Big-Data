*Type 4 Ka-Tsu
:Amphibious, armoured, cargo/troop tracked carrier that was developed by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The engine component and electric devices were watertight and it could be carried underwater attached to a submarine. The twin drive propeller shafts were designed to retract "into their ducts" once the vehicle reached shore.

*Type 5 To-Ku
:Amphibious tank armed with one 47 mm gun, one 25 mm Type 1 gun and two 7.7 mm Type 97 machine guns. The turret was a modified version of the one used on the Type 97 Shinhoto Chi-Ha with a Type 5 Chi-Ri hull. Only one prototype was built.

*Type 4 Ka-Sha
:Amphibious vehicle design based on the Type 4 Chi-To or Type 5 Chi-Ri chassis. Not produced, even as a prototype.

==Engineering vehicles==
*Experimental Trench Excavator
:Derived from the Type 97 Chi-Ha, it had a trench digging plow in the stern. This vehicle was made around 1941-42 for service in Manchuria. Some examples were sent to Wewak on the north coast of Papua-New Guinea for use by the Japanese 6th Div AIF.

*Type 2 Ho-I medium gun tank
:The Imperial Japanese Army called close fire support tanks, "gun tanks". The experimental model was based on the Chi-Ha and the production model was based on the Chi-He. The Ho-I mounted a short barrel Type 99 75 mm tank gun. They were intended to be deployed in a fire support company in each of the tank regiments. There is no record a Ho-I was used in action as they were deployed in Japan to defend against the expected Allied invasion.Taki’s Imperial Japanese Army: Type 2 "Ho-I"

*Type 97 Shinhoto Chi-Ha Short Barrel 120 mm gun tank

A limited number of "about a dozen" were produced for deployment by the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces.

==Self propelled guns==

*Type 1 Ho-Ni II 105 mm SPG
:Type 91 105 mm gun installed on the same modified Type 97 chassis as the Ho-Ni I with a slightly changed superstructure as far as the side armor with re-positioned observation visors.

*Type 3 Ho-Ni III 75 mm SP AT gun
:The Ho-Ni III had a Type 3 75 mm tank gun mount in a fully enclosed casemate and was deployed in tank regiments as a tank destroyer. Most were stationed within the Japanese home islands to defend against the projected Allied Invasion.
