Title: Tampere University


Tampere University (, shortened TAU) is a Finnish university that was established on 1 January, 2019 as a merger between the University of Tampere and Tampere University of Technology. The new university is also the major shareholder of Tampere University of Applied Sciences.

==History==
University of Tampere was founded in 1925 as the Civic College in Helsinki teaching public administration, organisation management and journalism. In 1930, a total of 195 students were enrolled at the College and its name was amended to the School of Social Sciences. As the institution grew, it expanded to municipal administration, public law, child protection, and civic education. Faculty of Social Sciences was established in 1949 as the first faculty. By 1960, the number of students had increased to 933 and the School of Social Sciences moved to Tampere. The institution was renamed to the University of Tampere in 1966.

Tampere had been the most important industrial center in Finland since the late 19th century. Agathon Meurman, member of the senate of Finland, had expressed the need for a technical higher institution already in the mid-19th century. Yet, even after the continuation war all technical higher education was conducted in Helsinki University of Technology. Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland, signed an edict for establishing a Tampere-based branch of the Helsinki University of Technology in 1965. The school began operating on the same year. The branch gained independent university status in 1972 and was named as Tampere University of Technology.Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu. Koskivoimaa. University of Tampere. Retrieved 2008-11-20. 

The two universities always had close relations and co-operation was common in the fields of economics, computer science, biotechnology, and medical technology. Therefore, merging the universities had been suggested multiple times. The Tampere3 merger process began in 2014 when vuorineuvos Stig Gustavson invited the higher education institutions in Tampere to discuss a reform. In 2015, the three universities decided the objectives on creating the new university in Tampere. In 2016, the Ministry of Education and Culture appointed a steering, and a working group to prepare the establishment of a new foundation university. Initially Tampere University of Applied Sciences was planned to merge into the new foundation, similarly to the other two universities. However, this would have required changes to legislation since Universities of Applied Sciences, or polytechnics, are not considered as Universities, in Finland, which can grant licentiate and doctorate degrees. The merger of the two universities was approved by the Finnish Parliament in December 2017 and came into effect on 1 January 2019. The university commune (TUNI) comprises the new Tampere University and the Tampere University of Applied Sciences, of which Tampere University is the major shareholder. 


In 2021 it was announced that Tampere University is trying to get rid of a large part of its premises. The goal is to reduce farms by 25% by 2030. This includes closing the University Library. The announcement was met with protest from faculty staff and students as they felt that there is a lack of transparency in the design of this decision, and that their voices were not heard in the matter.
