==Overview==
Swedish Dancesport Federation covers approximately 38,500 members in 156 associated danceclubs (2008), from Kiruna in the very north of Sweden to Malm√∂ in the south.

Swedish Dancesport Federation is divided into 9 regions. These regional dancesport federations are more often called districts.

The presidium is selected from the annual general meeting. The presidium comprises the federation's chairman and six general members, and three deputies selected from the annual meeting. In order to support the activities, the organisation is divided in different committees, whose members are elected by the presidium.
These committees are; Dance BRR (Bugg and Rock'n'Roll dances), Dance Tendance, Information-PR, Youth, Jurisprudence, District-Central Projects and Line Dance.

Dancesport within the association is divided in three dance categories. Namely Ballroom dancing (Tendance), Swing dances or as called in Sweden Bugg and Rock'n' Roll dances (in short terms just BRR dances) besides Line dance. Ballroom covers five Latin dances (Cha-Cha-Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso Doble and Jive), and five Standard dances (Slow Waltz, Tango, Slow Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz and Quickstep).
