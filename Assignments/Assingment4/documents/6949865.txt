Title: Shave the Planet



Shave the Planet is the ninth album by the Huntington Beach, California punk rock band Guttermouth, released in 2006 by Volcom Entertainment. It continued the band's style of fast, abrasive punk rock with tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics. The album was their first to feature drummer Ryan Farrell, and also marked the return of founding bassist Clint Weinrich, and was the final album to feature founding member Scott Sheldon and guitarist of four years Don Horne.
