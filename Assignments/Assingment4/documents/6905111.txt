He made his debut for Hearts in a League Cup win over Airdrie at Broomfield in 1981.

He won three caps for Scotland between 1988 and 1992 against Saudi Arabia, Northern Ireland and Canada and was part of the Scotland squad at Euro 92. He was perhaps unfortunate to play during a time when Scotland had the services of Jim Leighton and Andy Goram, which restricted his opportunities at international level. Additionally, he played two matches for the under-21s as an overage player.Scotland U21 player Smith, Henry, FitbaStats
