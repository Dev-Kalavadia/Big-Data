==Critical reception==
Jason Kane of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it The Third Eye Foundation's "most consistent" album to date. He added, "The percussion is meticulously constructed; each beat is placed for a purpose and new rhythms are exposed upon repeated listens." Kristen Sage Rockermann of Pitchfork gave the album a 5.8 out of 10, saying, "On Little Lost Soul, Elliot has pointlessly sugared the pill with smoother production, and as a result, the album lacks the power of the dreamworlds its eerie textures allude to."
