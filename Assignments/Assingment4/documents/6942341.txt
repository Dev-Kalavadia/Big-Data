==Audrey Hepburn==
After having appeared in a string of bit parts and small speaking roles, the film provided Audrey Hepburn with her first significant film role, leading to her big breakthrough in Roman Holiday: on 18 September 1951, shortly after Secret People was finished but before its premiere, Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with the young starlet and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing Roman Holiday. Wyler wrote a glowing note of thanks to Dickinson, saying that "as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her."BFI Film Forever, 22 January 2014: The letter that made Audrey Hepburn a star.

==Reception==
The film reviewer for The Times found Secret People to be "a confused, inarticulate, disappointing film, neither as imaginative nor as intellectually exciting as it should be."The Times, Monday 11 Feb. 1952, page 2: New Films in London - A plot with ideas. Retrieved 2015-04-20

In contrast, George Perry wrote in Forever Ealing that "...there is much of interest in the Ealing film, such as the moral dilemma of those who have to resort to force to overcome force."
He also praised "a sensitive performance by Valentina Cortesa, ...a substantial role for Audrey Hepburn", and felt that the film had been misinterpreted and "was in some respects ahead of its time."Forever Ealing by George Perry, Pavilion Books and M.Joseph 1981 -  Retrieved 2015-11-14

The film was a box office flop.
