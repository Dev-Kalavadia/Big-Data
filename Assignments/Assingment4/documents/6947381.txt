==Characteristics==
The characteristics of a Baha are:-
* A square or rectangular space bounded by buildings in all sides
* Surrounding buildings built on a raised platform called Falcha 
* Ground paved with brick or stone
* Generally centrally placed Chaitya
* Often presence of a well
* The building opposite to the main entrance generally houses a Guthi with idols of deities in the ground floor

==Significance==
The baha are generally constructed by a family and their descendants reside in it for generations. Hence, it is not just a unit of residence but also a unit of kinship. The Guthis of Newars have their basis on Baha. So, they play a great role in maintaining the norms of Newari society and lifestyle.
