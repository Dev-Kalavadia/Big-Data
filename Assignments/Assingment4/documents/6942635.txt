==Ayodhya dispute==
Shereen Ratnagar along with archaeologist D. Mandal spent a day, in 2003, examining the court-ordered excavations conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at the site of the Babri Masjid on behalf of the Sunni Central Waqf Board (the Muslim litigant in the dispute). Subsequently, the two researchers wrote a highly critical appraisal of the excavations by the ASI titled Ayodhya: Archaeology after Excavation. In 2010, they appeared as expert witnesses for the Sunni Waqf Board in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case in the Allahabad High Court.

In its judgement on the Ayodhya dispute, the High Court flayed the role played by several witnesses including Ratnagar, who was forced to admit under oath that she had no field experience in archaeological excavations in India.How Allahabad HC exposed experts espousing Masjid-cause, Times of India, 9 October 2010. Ratnagar and her supporters defend her record by stating that she has participated in some archaeological digs at sites outside India, such as Tell al-Rimah, Iraq, in 1971, Iraq Vol. 34, No. 2 (Autumn, 1972), pp. 77-86. Published by: British Institute for the Study of Iraq as well as in Turkey and the Gulf.Publisher's statement on Shereen Ratnagar, Trading Encounters (Oxford University Press, 2006)
