===Professional===

====2007 NFL Combine====


====Indianapolis Colts====
Gonzalez was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the 32nd selection in the 2007 NFL Draft, and was taken to become the Colts' slot receiver. He was one of three Ohio State receivers selected in that draft.

In Gonzalez's first year, he caught 37 passes for 576 yards and three touchdowns. The next season he caught 57 passes for 664 yards and four touchdowns.

In 2009, Gonzalez earned the starting wide receiver position along with Reggie Wayne after Marvin Harrison was released from the team in the off-season. He injured his right knee during the season opener against Jacksonville Jaguars and was expected to miss up to eight weeks. He failed to return that season and was placed on injured reserve on December 24.

In 2010, Gonzalez lost the starting wide receiver position due to missing the 2009 season. He played in a total of two games as a slot receiver with five catches for 67 yards and no touchdowns. He injured his left leg in week eight against the Houston Texans and was placed on Injured Reserve for the rest of the year.

Gonzalez's role in the Colts offense diminished even further during the 2011 season. He played in only eight games and did not catch a pass. He became an unrestricted free agent in the following off-season.

During Gonzalez's time with Indianapolis, the Colts won three AFC South Division titles (2007, 2009, 2010), an AFC Championship (2009), and a trip to Super Bowl XLIV.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
=== Elections ===

==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Gonzalez filed to run as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives in Ohio's 16th congressional district. His predecessor, Jim Renacci, was retiring to mount an unsuccessful Senate campaign against incumbent Sherrod Brown. Gonzalez won the November 6 election with 57% of the vote, becoming the first Latino to represent Ohio in Congress.Anthony Gonzalez, former Ohio State University football star, files to run for Congress in OhioHow the 9 former athletes running for office performed in Tuesday's election He raised more than $525,000 in less than a month after announcing his run, including donations from former NFL teammate Peyton Manning, Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, and several other former NFL and college football players.Peyton Manning, other sports figures get behind Anthony Gonzalez's bid for Congress Along with Texas Democrat Colin Allred, he was one of two former NFL players to be elected to Congress in 2018.

==== 2020 ====

Gonzalez defeated the Democratic nominee, physicist Aaron Paul Godfrey, 63.2% to 36.8%.

==== 2022 ====

Gonzalez originally ran for reelection in the 16th district, prompting a primary challenge from Republicans who supported former President Donald Trump due to Gonzalez's impeachment vote. Ohio's slow population growth in the 2020 United States census made the district obsolete as of 2023, leaving the campaigns' statuses unclear. On September 16, Gonzalez announced he would not run for Congress in 2022.

=== Tenure ===

The House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump on December 18, 2019, claiming Trump had abused the power of his office and obstructed the will of Congress by seeking foreign aid to influence the results of the 2020 election against challenger Joe Biden. Gonzalez voted not to impeach Trump, saying there was not enough evidence.
  
The Senate voted mostly on party lines to acquit Trump of the charges on February 5, 2020.

Just 12 days before the end of Trump's term, the House passed a second impeachment resolution with one article claiming "incitement of insurrection", before and during the U.S. Capitol attack. Gonzalez was one of ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for this offense. The Senate again acquitted Trump.

Ohio Republican Party chair Bob Paduchik said the second impeachment resolution addressed "an unconstitutional, politically motivated process that served no purpose." As a result of his vote to impeach Trump, the Ohio Republican Central Committee voted to censure Gonzalez, stating that Gonzalez had "betrayed his constituents" and "relied on emotions rather than the will of his constituents and any credible facts". Gonzalez and his family received continual threats following the impeachment vote, and he took additional security measures to protect his wife and family.

On May 19, 2021, Gonzalez was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol. In retaliation, Trump endorsed former White House aide Max Miller in the 2022 primary for the seat.Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham accuses congressional candidate of abuse, Washington Post, Felicia Sonmez, October 5, 2021. Retrieved October 6, 2021.

On October 21, 2021, Gonzalez was one of nine House Republicans who voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress. On November 5, 2021, he was among the 13 House Republicans to break with their party and vote with a majority of Democrats in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

==== Immigration ====
Gonzalez voted for the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

==== Same-sex marriage ====
On July 19, 2022, Gonzalez was one of 47 Republican Representatives to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.

==== Contraception====

Gonzalez voted for H.R. 8373 ("The Right to Contraception Act"), a bill designed to protect access to contraceptives and health care providers' ability to provide contraceptives and information about contraception. It would also fund Planned Parenthood.

==== Big Tech ====
In 2022, Gonzalez was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.
