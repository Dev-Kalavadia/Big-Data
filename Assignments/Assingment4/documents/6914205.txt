Title: Bihor (region)
Bihor is a geographical region in northeastern Montenegro. Bihor is situated nearby to Jagoče, and northeast of Lopare. The region is within three municipalities: Berane, Bijelo Polje, and Petnjica. It was named after Bihor, a former medieval town that was near Bijelo Polje. The region mainly consists of ethnic Bosniaks.

Upper Bihor is located in southwestern Sandžak in northeastern Montenegro. It has an area of about 143 km2. The region has an elevation of 922 metres (3,025 feet).

== History ==
In 1455, the Ottomans captured the city of Bihor. The town developed in the 16th century as the center of a kadiluk, with a garrison holding eight timars in 1530.

In 1878, Bihor became part of Montenegro. After the Balkan Wars and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, heavy pressure leads to the Muslims from Bihor moving to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Turkey. In 1914, a few thousand people from Bihor moved to Turkey, while the Eastern Orthodoxy followers begin moving in from various parts of Montenegro.

During the Second World War, Chetnik forces based in Montenegro conducted a series of ethnic cleansing operations against Muslims in the Bihor region. In May 1943, an estimated 5400 Albanian men, women and children in Bihor were massacred by Chetnik forces under Pavle Đurišić. The notables of the region then published a memorandum and declared themselves to be Albanians. The memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Ekrem Libohova whom they asked to intervene so the region could be united to the Albanian kingdom.

In the late 1940s, people from Bihor began moving to Vojvodina as colonists. Because of hard life in their new home, some people came back to Bihor. The migration of Muslims from this area to Turkey was intensive between 1956 and 1958. Today, the population is predominantly made up of Muslim Bosniaks with a minority of Serbian Orthodox followers.
