Title: Arctic Hospital 
Arctic Hospital (Eric Patrick Bray born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, January 8, 1985) is an American DJ and record producer. He began DJing industrial and EBM at age 14, and began producing urban techno on a Macintosh using the software sequencer Logic when he was 17. He was a pioneer of Belgian Jumpstyle, introducing the dance to North American partygoers at the WI Sandstorm raves of the early 2000s. In 2004, Eric Bray was signed to Narita Records after owner Gabe Koch saw him open for seminal techno DJ John Digweed. The music of Arctic Hospital is often described as dub techno.
