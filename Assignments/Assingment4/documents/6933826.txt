Pietro in Bellinzona (early 13th century), the hospital in Contone (1337) and the cathedral of Como (1397) all owned land in Sant'Antonino.  Until 1442, it was part of the Bellinzona parish.  Then it formed a parish with Cadenazzo, which remained until it dissolved in 1830.  The first church in the village is mentioned in 1291.

Beginning in the 1960s and 70s, it grew into a residential community, due to it close proximity to Bellinzona.
