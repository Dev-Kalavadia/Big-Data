Title: List of Colorado fourteeners



This is a list of mountain peaks in the U.S. State of Colorado that exceed  of elevation.

In the mountaineering parlance of the Western United States, a fourteener is a mountain peak with an elevation of at least 14,000 feet.  This is a complete list of the 53 fourteeners in the U.S. State of Colorado with at least  of topographic prominence.  See the main fourteener article, which has a list of all of the fourteeners in the United States, for some information about how such lists are determined and caveats about elevation and ranking accuracy.

The summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The topographic elevation of a summit measures the height of the summit above a geodetic sea level.
#The topographic prominence of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.
#The topographic isolation (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.
