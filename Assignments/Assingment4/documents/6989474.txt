Title: Conroy
Conroy is an Irish surname.

==Overview==

Conroy is an Irish surname of multiple origins. In some cases it is the form used by descendants of the Ó Maolchonaire bardic family of what is now East Galway and South Roscommon. In west County Galway, most bearers of the name are probably descended from the Mac Conraoi family of Delbhna Tír Dhá Locha. This latter Irish family name was often anglicised into King due to the phonological similarity with the word rí. The Ó Cingeadh/Ó Cionga bardic family from east of Loch Ree also had their name corrupted into King, but for English phonological reasons.
