Title: SYDI

SYDI (Script Your Documentation Instantly) is an open source project aimed at assisting system administrators do in documenting their networks. Hosted on SourceForge, the project provides scripts that target computers running Windows and Linxu operating systems. The Windows scripts are written in VBScrip, while the Linux script is written inPython.

Each script serves two basic functions: collecting and reporting. After targeting a system, the script collects information from the target and outputs it to either an  XML file or a Microsoft Word document.
