Title: 2006 Progressive Democrats leadership election


The Progressive Democrats leadership election, 2006 began on 7 September 2006 when Mary Harney resigned as leader of the Progressive Democrats.  In spite of speculation earlier in the year surrounding her position as leader, Harney's announcement surprised many.  She had been leader of the party since 1993.

==Election procedure==

According to the party's constitution, if there is just one candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Democrats, this person will be elected leader by acclamation.  If several candidates put their names forward, the next leader will be determined by an electoral college. Each member of this college will have one vote, but these votes will be weighed according to which group they belong to. TDs, Senators and MEPs will form the first group which represent 40% of the votes.  Councillors, national executive members and trustees of the party will form the second group which represent 30% of the votes.  The third group contains party members for more than one year prior to the date of the leadership election. This group represent 30% of the votes.

==Candidates==

Nominations for the leadership closed on midday Monday, 11 September 2006.

Michael McDowell was  nominated for the position of Party Leader by Tom Parlon and that nomination is to be seconded by Liz O'Donnell.

==Result==

Despite speculation of differences, Michael McDowell was elected unopposed, and remained in office until he resigned on losing his seat in the 2007 general election.
