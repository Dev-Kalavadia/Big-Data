Maroggia is a former municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. On 10 April 2022, the former municipalities of Maroggia, Melano and Rovio merged to form the new municipality of Val Mara.

==History==
Maroggia is first mentioned around 962-966 as Marogia.

The Maroggia area has been inhabited since the Iron Age.  In 1906, a northern Etruscan inscription was discovered, followed by a Roman era stele in 1926.  The Lombards King Liutprand gave the village to church of S. Carpoforo in Como in 724.  Later it went to the Benedictine abbey of S. Ambrogio in Milan.  In 1798, it joined the short-lived Republic of Riva San Vitale.

The village belonged to the parish church of Riva San Vitale until 1644 when it became an independent parish.  The parish church of St. Peter is first mentioned in 1579, but was built in the Early Middle Ages.  The new building was built in 1640 and restored in 1982-83.  On the foundation of a building from the 16th Century the pilgrimage chapel of Madonna della Cintura was built in 1731-66.

Historically, the villager earned their living from fishing and making charcoal.  The current mill, which was fully automated in 2000, dates from the 19th Century.  At the same time, there was a paper factory and a food processing plant.  In 1878 Romeo Manzoni opened a girls' boarding school, which was named after him.  The school was sold in 1905, to the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales who established the Don Bosco College in the building.  In 2000 about two-thirds of the workers, worked outside the municipality.  In 2005, over half of the jobs in the municipality were in the industrial sector of the economy.
