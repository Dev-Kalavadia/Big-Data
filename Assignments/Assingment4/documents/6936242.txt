Title: Akadimia Platonos


Akadimia Platonos ( ) literally meaning Plato's Academy, is a neighbourhood located  west-northwest of the downtown part of the Greek capital of Athens.

==History==

The area is named after Plato's Academy, which he founded in the area in 387 BC and which continued to operate until it was destroyed by the Roman dictator Sulla in 86 BC.Lindberg, David C. (2007). The Beginnings of Western Science. University of Chicago Press. p. 70. . Excavations of Ancient artefacts began in 1929 and continue to the present day, under the auspices of the third General Directorate of Antiquities.

The area saw housing developments in the early part of the 20th century when Athens began to grow. An industrial zone was also laid out during this time. The area was mostly urbanised during the period after World War II and the civil war.

==Present day==

The area is densely populated, with people mainly living in five to seven-story buildings.  Major streets bordering this subdivision include Lenorman Avenue to the east, Palamidou Street to the south and Athinon Avenue (GR-8 and GR-8A and E90 westbound.)

The two main squares are Akademia Platonos and Metaxa. The population is approximately 15,000.

==Residential streets==
Several residential streets are named after places in the Peloponnese, famous people, and myths.
