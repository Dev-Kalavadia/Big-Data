Melano is a former municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. On 10 April 2022, the former municipalities of Maroggia, Melano and Rovio merged to form the new municipality of Val Mara.

==History==
A Roman era necropolis was discovered in the municipality.  The modern village of Melano is first mentioned in 799 as Mellani.  In 1192 it was mentioned as Melano.  In 847, the Benedictine Abbey of Sant'Ambrogio of Milan owned land in Melano.  In the Middle Ages the city of Como, controlled the port of Melano.  During their wars against Milan in the early 12th Century, the port was of strategic importance.  In the Late Middle Ages there was a wall between Melano and Capolago (first mentioned in 1449) that led down to the lake from Monte Generoso.  In 1798, Melano belonged to the short-lived Republic of Riva San Vitale.

Melano was part of the parish of Riva San Vitale until 1591 when it became an independent parish.  The Parish Church of St. Andrew was built in the 15th Century, totally rebuilt in 1846-50 and restored in 1992–94.  In 1634-37 the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Castelletto was built on a previous, 14th Century building.  It was restored in 1985-87 and is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in the Ticino.

Agriculture, livestock, forestry and seasonal migrations have long been the main sources of income.  In 1840 Giovanni Battista Fogliardi opened one of the first silk mills in Ticino in Melano.  At the beginning of the 21st Century much of the economy is based around tourism.
