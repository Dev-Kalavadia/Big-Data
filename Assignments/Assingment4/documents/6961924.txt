Title: Eeswar



Eeswar is a 2002 Indian Telugu-language action drama film directed by Jayanth C. Paranjee, starring Prabhas and Sridevi Vijaykumar.  Siva Krishna and Revathi played supporting roles. It marked the debut of Prabhas, nephew of popular Telugu actor Krishnam Raju. However, it didn't prove him well enough as a popular hero until the release of his blockbuster Varsham.  The film was later dubbed into Hindi as Humla: The War (2009) and into Bengali as Bhalobashar Jeet.

==Plot==
Eeswar (Prabhas) is a motherless child and brat living in Dhoolpet, a slum area in Old City. Eeswar's father (Siva Krishna) manufactures Gudumba (Arrack) with the help of neighborhood people. Eeswar falls in love at first sight when he sees a college-going beauty Indu (Sridevi Vijaykumar). In the meantime, Eeswar's father marries Sujatha (Revathi), who has been waiting for him for the past 20 years so that she can be a good mother to Eeswar. Eeswar hates his stepmother thinking that his father married her to enjoy worldly pleasures. Meanwhile, Indu's father turns out to be a local MLA (Kolla Ashok Kumar) who hates poor. The local MLA sends goons to finish Eeswar off. What follows next forms the second half of the film.
