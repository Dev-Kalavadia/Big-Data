Title: Alajos Hauszmann



Alajos Hauszmann (also called as Alois, June 9, 1847 – July 31, 1926) was a Hungarian architect, professor, and member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

==Life==
Hauszmann was born in Buda in 1847 into a family of Bavarian origin as the son of Ferenc Hauszmann and Anna Maár (siblings: Hermina (1845–1929), Ferenc (1850–1918) and Kornélia (1854-1837)).  He studied painting from 1861, then became a bricklayer's apprentice.  In 1864 he attended Technical University of Budapest, and in 1866 he continued architecture studies at the Bauakademie in Berlin, along with Ödön Lechner.
* 1868 Assistant Professor at the Technical University of Budapest

Hauszmann employed several architects who later became prominent in their own right, including Albert Kálmán Kőrössy. In 1912 Hauszmann retired, and a year later he created a foundation for young architects graduating from the Technical University.  In 1914 he went on an extended journey to Egypt and the Holy Land.  In 1918 he was ennobled by King Charles IV of Hungary; however, in the following year, his private home was confiscated during the Hungarian Soviet Republic.  In 1924 he was elected an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  He died, aged 79, in Velence.
