Title: WBCB (AM)

WBCB is an AM broadcast station licensed to operate on 1490  kHz for Levittown, Pennsylvania, and serving the areas of Bucks County, Pennsylvania and other parts of suburban Philadelphia.  Its programming mixes news, talk, music and local sports.

WBCB began broadcasting on December 8, 1957 by owner Drew J.T. O'Keefe, who was a Main Line attorney. He owned the station until his death in the late 1980s. The early years were marked by the emergence of soon to be big name personalities like Bill Bircher and Horace Greely McNabb. Since 1992, the station has been owned by local businessman Pasquale T. Deon Jr. and veteran Philadelphia Eagles broadcaster Merrill Reese, who was a WBCB alumnus early in his career.
