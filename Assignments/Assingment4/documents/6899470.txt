In 1978, during restoration work in the church, a remarkable gravestone for a Roman Centurion of  Legio XV Apollinaris, who is also described as a 'Negotiator'  or trader,  was found in the wall of the sacristy. The inscription is as follows:

According to Dr. Titus KolníkT Kolnik, ‘Q. Atilius Primus-Interprex, Centurio und Negotiator’, Acta Arch Hungarica 30 (1978), 61 inscription translates as: 
Quintus Atilius Primus, son of Spurio Tribune Votbrimus (or of the tribe Voturina.H Elton 'Frontiers of the Roman Empire', Routledge 2013, 80, gives an alternative translation 'Here lies Quintus Atilius Primus, son of Spurius, of the tribe of Voturina, interpreter of legio XV, centurion of the same, 80 years old. His heirs Quintus Atilis Cositutus, Atilia Quinta freedwoman, Fausta and Martialis placed this Interpreter XV. Legion centurion and businessman. He lived 80 years, is buried here. Quintus Atilius Cogitatus, Atilia, Quint L EAV Privatus and Martialis heirs. P had erected. The XV legion was stationed at Carnuntum, a Roman Limes, or frontier fort on the Danube and the gravestone is likely to date from between 90-138AD. As Boldog lies between  Bratislava and Trnava, to the east of the Danube, Quintus Atilius Primus must have died outside the area of the Roman Empire. This might indicate that there was a trading post in the vicinity, to which he moved after his career in the Roman Army.

==The Parish Church==

The Church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is one of a group of Romanesque churches in Western Slovakia. The first phase dates from first half of the 12th century, or even the 11th century AD. Around 1220 the church was extended to the west, and a tower built with a triple  tiered arrangement of Romanesque window openings. Brick was used for this extension, as was the case at  Dražovce church near Nitra.
Other Romanesque features include a finely carved baptismal font, a decorative  Tympanum over the west door and grotesque animal head brackets below the eaves of the roof.Oriško, Š.: Románske umenie na Slovensku - maliarstvo a sochárstvo.

In 1280 the Church and the village came into the ownership of the Poor Clares and between 1364 and 1370 they made modifications to the church in the Gothic style.www.apsida.sk - profil románskeho kostola- a website discussing Romanesque churches in the Bratislava area
