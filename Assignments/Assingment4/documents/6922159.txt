==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed A Stainless Steel Rat is Born for White Dwarf #77, and stated that "No sequel will match the saga's first book, but this comes close: Jim's family isn't around to get in his light, the action doesn't get so excessively silly or grim as to fragment the story, and it climaxes on one of those ghastly low-tech planets in which Harrison delights."
