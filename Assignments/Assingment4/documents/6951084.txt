==History==

Indemini is first mentioned in 1260 as Indemine. In the Middle Ages it was part of the Vicinanza of Gambarogno.  In the 17th century there were disputes over alpine pastures and forest owned by the village cooperatives of the Valle Veddasca and the Malcantone.  In 1752, these border disputes were resolved with the Treaty of Varese.  In 1800, the Helvetic government considered exchanging Indemini for Campione d'Italia in the Cisalpine Republic.

A vice-parish was formed in 1556 after they broke away from the parish of Vira.  The church of San Bartolomeo, which is probably built before 1213, was expanded in the 17th century and renovated in the 19th century.

The village was isolated for most of its history.  It wasn't until 1917–18 that a roadway was built on the Swiss side.  A road from Italy wasn't built until 1964.  The isolation helped Indemini to retain its rural appearance.  In the past, the village economy relied on agriculture, but it declined in importance in the 1970s and 80s.  During most of the year, the village is mostly abandoned, but in the summer season the population expands rapidly.
