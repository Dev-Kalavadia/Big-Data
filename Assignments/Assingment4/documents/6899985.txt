Title: Forever Pop

Forever Pop is a collection of new (at the time) remixes of older Alphaville songs and singles. The people responsible for some of the remixes include notables such as Paul Van Dyk, Mark Plati, and De-Phazz.

==Reviews==

One reviewer had positive things to say about the collection, noting that most of the remixes "maintain the beauty of the original music," although one mix (the Eiffel 65 mix) is an exception: it strays "too far away from the original song while not adding anything interesting to win over the listener." Overall, the collection was referred to as "refreshing" and "stunning."
