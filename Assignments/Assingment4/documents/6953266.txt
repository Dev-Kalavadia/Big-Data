Title: Greatest Hits Live (Ramones album)

Greatest Hits Live is the third live album by the punk rock band the Ramones. It was released in 1996 on Radioactive Records.

==Background==
The album was recorded at The Academy in New York City on February 29, 1996.

Its final two songs are bonus studio tracks that are covers, neither of which appeared on a Ramones album previously. "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." is originally by Motörhead, from the group's album 1916; the song was written as a tribute to the Ramones. The other is "Anyway You Want It", originally by The Dave Clark Five. Some editions do not feature the studio tracks. Two versions of the "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." cover song were recorded; one version that features Joey Ramone singing, and another version that features C.J. Ramone singing, which had previously been released as a bonus track on some editions of ¡Adios Amigos!.

The album's packaging features still shots from the video of the band's cover of the Spider-Man theme song. More still shots are featured in the booklet.
