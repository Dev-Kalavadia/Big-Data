Title: Kalidas Samman



The Kalidas Samman () is an arts award presented annually by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in India. The award is named after Kālidāsa, a renowned Classical Sanskrit writer of ancient India. The Kalidas Samman was first awarded in 1980. It was initially conferred in alternate years in four fields: Classical Music, Classical Dance, Theatre and Plastic Arts. From 1986-87 to 2008-09, the awards were presented in all four fields in most years, thereafter reverting to one person per year.
