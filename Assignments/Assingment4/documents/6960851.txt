Title: Oops (Oh My)



"Oops (Oh My)" is a song by American singer Tweet from her debut studio album, Southern Hummingbird (2002). It features vocals from American rapper Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott, who co-wrote the song with Tweet, while production was handled by Timbaland. The song was released on January 11, 2002, as the album's lead single.

"Oops (Oh My)" was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping Billboards Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Additionally, it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. English electropop band Ladytron covered the song on their 2003 compilation album Softcore Jukebox.

==Writing and composition==
"Oops (Oh My)" is an R&B song featuring a techno-reggae rhythm, built on a Casio-bass clarinet loop. Although the song is widely considered to be about masturbation, Tweet explained that "[p]eople can take their definition of what any song means to them, but for me, the song wasn't about masturbation—it was about self-love." She said she was inspired to write the song after watching an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show where a doctor advised people to look at themselves in the mirror naked in order to build self-acceptance. She added that it was "empowering" for her to write the song as she "felt like [she] didn't love [herself]" due to her skin color.
