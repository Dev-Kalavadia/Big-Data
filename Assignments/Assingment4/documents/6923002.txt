==Background and meaning==
"When I'm Gone" was written by Brad Arnold, Matthew Roberts, Todd Harrell and Christopher Henderson. "There are only a few songs we’ve written on the road and 'When I’m Gone' is the only hit we’ve written on the road," Todd Harrell said on the band's official website. "We were playing it in Europe and could immediately tell it was something special. From day one, it got the crowd up. I always knew it would do well," Harrell continued.

Brad Arnold wrote the song thinking of unconditional love, for when being removed from loved one by miles, or time, or other obstacles. "When I'm Gone" does not necessarily mean being gone permanently. "It's asking a question, just please love me when I'm gone. And not just like when I'm dead and gone, but when I'm gonna come back. And that's kind of one thing it's about. But at the same time it's kind of about unconditional love. It's a lot of different statements it's asking of the person in that song. And it's like just the fulfillment of those different needs for every situation that it mentions. So I guess that song is just about needing someone really to be there for you unconditionally, and when you're gone," Arnold said of the song.
