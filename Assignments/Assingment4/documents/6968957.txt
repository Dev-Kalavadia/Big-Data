Born in Tokyo within a former Samurai family, Tada first studied his family's style of archery (Heki-Ryū Chikurin-ha Ban-pa) under his father in the family's house in Jiyūgaoka. He then became a member of the Waseda University karate club before starting training in aikido at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo under aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba in March 1950. He was dispatched to Rome, Italy, in 1964 where he established the Italian Dojo Centrale in 1967, and the national association Aikikai d'Italia in 1970. He returned to Japan in 1971 to resume teaching at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo.Tada Hiroshi, 9° dan, Direttore dell'Aikikai d'Italia  by Aikikai d'Italia. Italy.

To supplement aikido training, he has developed a system of breathing and meditative exercises called ki no renma  (気の錬磨, cultivation of ki) based largely on the teachings of Nakamura Tempu and the Ichikukai Dojo. LA PRATICA INTERIORE : IL KI-NO-RENMA
