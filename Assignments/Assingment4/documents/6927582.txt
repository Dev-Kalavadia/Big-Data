Parramatta was laid down on 9 November 1938 at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales. She was launched on 10 June 1939 and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) on 8 April 1940.

==Operational history==
Parramatta was assigned to the Red Sea Force in July 1940, and arrived in Aden at the month's end.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 154 The majority of the ship's duties were escorting convoys. The sloop was later transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet.Goldrick, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 118

While in the Mediterranean, Parramatta was one of several warships used to supply and support the Allied forces besieged at Tobruk, nicknamed the Tobruk Ferry Service. While operating off Tobruk on 24 June 1941, Parramatta, the British sloop , and the petrol carrier Pass of Balmaha were attacked by over 70 dive bombers. The Australian warship shot down three aircraft during the engagement without receiving major damage, but Auckland was sunk. Parramatta later helped recover the 164 survivors.
