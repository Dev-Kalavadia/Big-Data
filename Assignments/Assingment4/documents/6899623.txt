Specifically emphasizing the need for stronger anti-discrimination legislation, the Alliance has focused on the desires of South Asians, specifically the Nepalese population in Hong Kong.

The party's support for peace and reconciliation, including between mainland China and Taiwan, is at odds with official policy. This and other disagreement may have led to the August 4, 2008 closure of e-Wiki, a collaborative wiki website that hosted articles linking party chairman James Lung to the banned Falun Gong movement and which described his criticism of China's Communist Party.Reporters without Borders, August 7, 2008.
