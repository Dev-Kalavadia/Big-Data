Over the course of the next year, Baird published some of the magazine's most famous writers, including H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, and Seabury Quinn.Carter, p. 37.

Baird—in marked contrast to his successor—accepted everything that Lovecraft submitted to the magazine,Joshi and Schultz, p. 305. including "The Hound", "Arthur Jermyn", "The Statement of Randolph Carter", "The Cats of Ulthar", "Dagon", "The Picture in the House", "The Rats in the Walls", "Hypnos" and "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs".Carter, pp. 32-35. He did, however, insist that Lovecraft retype his first submissions using double spacing, causing the author to remark, "I am not certain whether or not I should bother."H. P. Lovecraft, letter to Frank Belknap Long, May 13, 1923; cited in Carter, p. 33.

Under Baird's editorship, Weird Tales lost a considerable amount of money—estimated at $51,000.Carter, pp. 35-37. After the April 1924 issue, Henneberger fired him and offered his job to Lovecraft.Carter, pp. 41-43.
