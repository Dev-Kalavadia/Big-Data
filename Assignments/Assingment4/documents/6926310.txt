In November 2006 the Torquay-based newspaper the Herald Express reported that Jacobson was likely to sign for Torquay United on loan, a story backed up by the team's official website. However, the move fell through when Torquay failed to loan Martin Phillips to Exeter City and Torquay chairman Chris Roberts refused to sanction the deal. He joined Accrington Stanley on loan and started their Football League Two match away at Grimsby on 25 November, followed by a Football League Trophy quarter-final tie away at League One club Doncaster Rovers on the following Tuesday.

In February 2007, Jacobson joined Bristol Rovers on loan until the end of the season, and then signed on a permanent basis in the summer of 2007.

Jacobson was the subject of controversy after executing a tackle on Kieron Dyer during a second round League Cup match against West Ham United on 28 August 2007. The tackle broke Dyer's tibia and fibula bones in his right leg, rendering him unavailable for both domestic and international selection. West Ham's manager Alan Curbishley, was furious initially accusing Jacobson of conducting himself maliciously, however this was dismissed with a written apology to Jacobson when Curbishley saw the tackle again.BBC (2007) Curbishley fury at Dyer leg break, 29 August.

The following day he scored his first goal for the club as they beat Bury 1–0. On 31 January 2011 he signed for Stanley on a permanent basis, helping them to achieve a playoff place.

===Shrewsbury Town===
Following the expiration of his Accrington contract, on 28 June 2011 it was announced that he would join Shrewsbury Town on a two-year deal. In an interview he told reporters: "it's the place I wanted to be." Joe made his first appearance for Shrewsbury Town in a 2–0 home win against Crewe Alexandra
 and scored his first goal as a Shrewsbury player in a 7–2 away win against Northampton Town. In the 2011–12 season he made 45 appearances for Shrewsbury Town in all competitions establishing himself as first-choice left-back with manager Graham Turner. In the 2012–13 season, he was selected as captain in the absence of Matt Richards as Shrewsbury confirmed their League One status in a 0–0 draw away at Colchester United on 20 April 2013. He retained this role for the final two matches of the season, also scoring in both, against Oldham Athletic and Portsmouth.

By playing an undisclosed number of matches for Shrewsbury Town, Jacobson triggered a clause in his contract to earn another year, extending his stay to the end of the 2013–14 season. Following Shrewsbury's relegation, Jacobson was released at the end of his contract.

===Wycombe Wanderers===
On 1 July 2014, Jacobson signed a two-year contract with Wycombe Wanderers following his release from Shrewsbury Town. He scored his first career hat-trick with a free kick and two direct corners in a 3–1 win over Lincoln City.
