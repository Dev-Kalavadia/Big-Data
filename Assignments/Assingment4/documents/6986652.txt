Title: Volatile Works


Volatile Works is a five-member film and new media art collective in Montreal, Quebec established in 2003.

==Activities==
The Volatile Works collective has produced works in diverse mediums, genres, and styles, with an emphasis on do-it-yourself forms of production. Their works have appeared in over 140 film and new media art festivals in over 28 countries around the world. The collective  organizes regular short film screenings, and has collaborated with other collectives and musicians on community-based screenings, workshops in activist video, 16 mm & Super-8 projections, and music videos. Their media include digital video, Super-8, 16mm, animation, web art, sound, installation art, and live performances. In 2007, they were named "Noisemakers" by the Montreal Mirror.

From La Revue de la Cinémathèque Québécoise (Sept-Dec. 2007), by Domique Dugas: "Volatile Works is composed of five very strong and distinct signatures, from Witcaky's experimental films that cross avant-garde accents with surrealism, to DeGiglio-Bellemare's B-movie and horror film explorations seasoned with agitprop perspectives, to Pomgrenade's anti-militarism and politically engaged cinema." (Translated from the French).
