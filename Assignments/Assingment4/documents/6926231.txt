Title: 2006 Washington Redskins season


The 2006 season was the Washington Redskins' 75th in the National Football League, and the third under head coach Joe Gibbs since his return to the team in 2004.

The team had posted a 10–6 record and a postseason berth the previous season (up from 6–10 in 2004). In 2006, however, the Redskins posted only five wins and finished last in the division.

The 2006 Redskins set an NFL record for fewest takeaways in a (non-strike) NFL season, with only twelve.The 1982 Baltimore Colts had 11 takeaways in nine games

==Offseason==
After the end of the 2005 season, the Redskins were reported to be $20 million over the salary cap. However, due to the NFL and NFL Players' Union agreement the salary cap was raised to $102 million and LaVar Arrington paying $4.4 million of his salary back, Washington managed to get under the cap.

The Redskins released 3-time Pro Bowl linebacker LaVar Arrington and starting safeties Ryan Clark and Matt Bowen.

The Redskins signed the following free agents: wide receiver Antwaan Randle El, defensive end Andre Carter, strong safety Adam Archuleta, and tight end Christian Fauria. They also traded draft picks for wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, quarterback Todd Collins and running back T. J. Duckett

In the 2006 NFL Draft, the Redskins did not have a first round pick due to a 2005 trade used to acquire quarterback Jason Campbell. However, they traded up in the second round to draft linebacker Rocky McIntosh out of the University of Miami, who was slated to be the replacement for Arrington. The Redskins then used their next pick on Minnesota DT Anthony Montgomery. The rest of their picks included Northern Colorado Safety Reed Doughty, Georgia DT Kedric Golston, Arizona Guard Kili Lefotu, and Tennessee LB Kevin Simon (who was later cut).

The Redskins finished the 2006 preseason with a record of 0–4, losing to the Cincinnati Bengals 19–3, the New York Jets 27–14, the New England Patriots 41–0 and the Baltimore Ravens 17–10. Starting running back Clinton Portis was injured in the first game of the preseason. The Redskins scored the fewest points of any team in the preseason.

The Redskins severed long-standing ties with radio station WJFK-FM for broadcasting rights to Redskins games. The new flagship station is Triple X ESPN Radio, which consists of three simulcast frequencies that cover the greater Washington, D.C. area.

==Regular season==


===Week 1: vs. Minnesota Vikings===

at FedExField, Landover, Maryland

The Redskins started the regular season against the Minnesota Vikings at home on September 11, in the first game of an ESPN Monday Night Football doubleheader on opening weekend. The Redskins defense allowed Minnesota quarterback Brad Johnson and the Vikings' offense to convert often on third down, and the Vikings won the game 19–16 after a failed field goal attempt by John Hall late in the fourth quarter quieted any chance of a Redskins comeback. With the loss, the Redskins were 0–1.Stats

===Week 2: at Dallas Cowboys===

at Texas Stadium, Dallas, Texas

The Redskins traveled to Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas to take on one of their NFC East rivals, the Dallas Cowboys in a Sunday night match-up. The Redskins trailed early, as Dallas kicker Mike Vanderjagt completed a 26-yard field goal and Drew Bledsoe completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton in the first quarter. In the second quarter, kicker John Hall would get Washington a 39-yard field goal, but Dallas responded with RB Marion Barber's 1-yard TD run. RB Rock Cartwright would return a kickoff 100 yards for a TD, but that would be the last time in the entire game that Redskins would score a single point. Even though there wouldn't be a single point scored in the third quarter, the Cowboys sealed the win with a 40-yard TD pass to WR Terry Glenn and a 50-yard field goal by Vanderjagt. With the loss, the Redskins dropped to 0–2. Stats

===Week 3: at Houston Texans===

at Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas

===Week 5: at New York Giants===

at Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey

Mark Brunell and the Redskins marched into Giants Stadium with a victory in mind. It ended up being misery within three hours, as they lost to a team who, at the time, had a poorly rated defense. Clinton Portis rushed for 76 yards. Santana Moss caught 3 receptions for only 39 yards, while Chris Cooley beat out Santana Moss with 4 receptions for 41 yards. Total offense for the Redskins was 164 yards, while the New York Giants put up 411 yards. The Redskins defense ended up with no sacks, interceptions, or turnovers. John Hall was 1/2 on field goals with no PATs. With another loss, the Redskins dropped to 2–3. Stats

===Week 6: vs Tennessee Titans===

at FedExField, Landover, Maryland

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Giants, the Redskins returned home for a Week 6 fight with the Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, Washington trailed early as Tennessee kicker Rob Bironas kicked a 32-yard field goal. RB Clinton Portis got a 10-yard TD run to help the Redskins regain the lead. In the second quarter, the Skins increased their lead with QB Mark Brunell completing a 24-yard TD pass to TE Chris Cooley. However, the Titans regained the lead with Bironas nailing a 26-yard field goal and QB Vince Young completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones. In the third quarter, the Redskins continued to dig themselves a huge hole, as RB Travis Henry got a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Titans got a safety on a blocked punt that rolled out the back of the end zone. In the fourth quarter, Washington tried valiantly to fight back, as Portis got a 4-yard TD run, but in the end, Bironas got a 30-yard field goal for Tennessee and a late interception by Free Safety Lamont Thompson killed any chance of a comeback. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 2–4. Stats

===Week 7: at Indianapolis Colts===

at the RCA Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana

The Redskins started the game looking to prevent Peyton Manning from overwhelming their defense, and hoping to drive the ball in a more effective manner. What was a close game at the half however quickly degenerated into a blood bath in the 3rd quarter as Peyton Manning connected on 3 touchdown passes to seal the deal. Overall, the offense again looked confused, and surprisingly it was the defense of the Redskins that ended up giving up big running plays on a regular basis. With the loss, the Redskins dropped to 2–5 for the season. Stats

===Week 9: vs. Dallas Cowboys===


at FedExField, Landover, Maryland

Coming off their Bye Week, the Redskins avenged their Week 2 loss by defeating the Dallas Cowboys after a wild final minute of the fourth quarter which ended with a game-winning 47-yard field goal by kicker Nick Novak. With less than a minute left in the fourth quarter, Novak missed from 49 yards. With nine seconds left Dallas kicker Mike Vanderjagt's field goal was blocked by newly signed Redskins cornerback Troy Vincent, and recovered by Redskins free safety Sean Taylor, who ran the ball down to the Dallas 45-yard line as time expired. During the runback by Taylor, Dallas offensive lineman Kyle Kosier grabbed his facemask and pulled it, adding an additional fifteen yards to the play and, since the penalty was defensive in nature, extended regulation by one additional play as a period cannot end on a defensive penalty according to NFL rules. Novak then came back out to hit the game winner and give the Redskons their third win of the year.Stats

===Week 10: at Philadelphia Eagles===

at Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia

In their first game against the Eagles, the Redskins lost in convincing fashion, 27–3. Although they dominated the time of possession in the first half and had several long drives, they came away with only three points. On the other hand, the Eagles had several big plays which resulted in scores, including a second half interception for a touchdown. With the loss the Redskins fell to 3–6.Stats

On the Monday after this game, it was announced that quarterback Mark Brunell was being benched in favor of second-year quarterback Jason Campbell.

===Week 11: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers===

at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida

New starting quarterback Jason Campbell played his first game at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Only field goal points took the first half, with both teams tied at halftime 3–3. In the second half Jason Campbell threw a three-yard touchdown pass to TE Chris Cooley, then Bruce Gradkowski threw a three-yard touchdown pass intended for Galloway but instead bounced off him into Becht's hands, making the game tied in the third quarter 10–10. Though the Redskins performed fairly well in the fourth quarter, Jason Campbell throwing another touchdown pass to Yoder, the Buccaneers had already pulled ahead by ten points. The final score was 20–17, Bucs, dropping the Redskins to 3–7. Stats

===Week 12: vs. Carolina Panthers===

at FedExField, Landover, Maryland

In his first game at home as the starter for the Redskins, Jason Campbell, again, had an encouraging game completing 11 of 23 passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. A rather dull first half for both teams saw the scoreboard read 6–3 in favor of Carolina. In the second half Jason Campbell threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle El and the Redskins took the lead at 10–6. In the fourth quarter Steve Smith scored on an 8-yard pass from Jake Delhomme to give Carolina a 13–10 lead. Later in the fourth quarter Jason Campbell threw to Chris Cooley for a 66-yard touchdown giving the Redskins the lead for good. Carolina threatened near the end of the game, but a Jake Delhomme pass was intercepted in the endzone by Redskins Safety Sean Taylor. With the 17–13 victory, the Redskins record stood at 4–7. Stats

at FedExField, Landover, Maryland

Afterwards, Suisham would kick a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Washington started to come back with Suisham kicking a 32-yard field goal, while QB Jason Campbell completed a 34-yard TD pass to WR Antwaan Randle El.
