Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods is a live album by Coil, originally released in CD-R format in a limited edition of 230 copies. The release is a live performance in Jesi, Italy on 11 July 2004. This is the final release before the death of the lead vocalist John Balance in November at the same year.

Selvaggina was released in a sleeve identical to that of Coil Presents Time Machines, Megalithomania!, and the original version of Black Antlers.
