Title: Prix du Conseil de Paris



|}








































The Prix du Conseil de Paris is a Group 2 flat horse race in France open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 2,400 metres (about  miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in October.

==History==
The event was established in 1893, and it was originally called the Prix du Conseil Municipal. It was funded by Paris Municipal Council, which had recently signed a new leasehold of Longchamp Racecourse.

The Prix du Conseil Municipal was the second major international race introduced by the Société d'Encouragement. The first, the Grand Prix de Paris, had been launched thirty years earlier. Unlike that event, which was restricted to three-year-olds, the new race was open to horses aged three or older. The basic weights to be carried were 53 kg for three-year-olds and 58 kg for their elders. A penalty of up to 6 kg could be incurred for previous performances.

With an initial prize of 100,000 francs, the Prix du Conseil Municipal was France's second richest race after the Grand Prix de Paris. Prior to the creation of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, it was the most prestigious event of Longchamp's autumn schedule.

Before World War I, the race regularly featured horses trained outside France. Three British horses were successful during this period. The event was abandoned throughout the war, with no running from 1914 to 1918. The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was introduced in 1920, and from this point the Prix du Conseil Municipal took place a week later. The interval was increased to a fortnight in 1925.

The race was cancelled once during World War II, in 1939. It was run at Auteuil over 2,600 metres in 1940, and at Le Tremblay over 2,300 metres in 1943 and 1944.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix du Conseil Municipal was classed at Group 2 level. It was renamed the Prix du Conseil de Paris in 1974, after reforms to the statutes of Paris.
