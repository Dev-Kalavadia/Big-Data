==History as ORP Ślązak==
Ślazak was commissioned on 17 April 1942. During the Second World War she took part in 32 patrols and escorted 104 convoys.Kozłowski, Wiszenko:
 ORP Ślązak L26, polishgreatness.com Ślązak was one of eight Hunt-class ships that took part in the Dieppe Raid. At Dieppe she saved 85 soldiers of the Royal Regiment of Canada, trapped at the beach after landing.STEPHEN HUEBL: CPT. ROMUALD NALECZ TYMINSKI - Polish Canadian, 1905–2003, stefanbatoryoceanliner.weebly.com During the invasion of Normandy she was supporting the landing at Sword. She was the lead destroyer for the lead flotilla of minesweepers that morning, which was symbolic because the invasion of Poland by German forces had initiated the conflict. As a convoy escort her crew shot down five enemy aircraft (and possibly three more).

After the war she was decommissioned in 1946 and transferred back to the Royal Navy.
