The planning application received the highest level of support Cornwall Council had ever received for a planning application.

Planning consent for the new heliport was first granted in a unanimous decision by Cornwall Council's Strategic Planning Committee in February 2017. The decision was later challenged by the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company in a judicial review. A petition against the Judicial Review gained more than 11,000 signatures and an amended planning application was submitted.

The amended application was granted planning consent in a second unanimous decision by Cornwall Council in August 2018.

The new heliport was built during 2018 and 2019, with services commencing in March 2020, flying to the islands of St Mary's and Tresco.
