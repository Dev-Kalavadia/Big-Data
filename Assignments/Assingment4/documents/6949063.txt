Title: Seven Tears (song)

"Seven Tears" is a popular song by the Goombay Dance Band, released in 1981. It was released as the only single from their third studio album, Holiday in Paradise, and was subsequently featured on the UK-only compilation Seven Tears.

Written by Wolff-Ekkehardt Stein and Wolfgang Jass, and produced by Jochen Peterson, "Seven Tears" was a major hit across Europe in the winter and spring of 1982. The song spent three weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart, being the fourth time a German act had topped the UK chart, six weeks after Kraftwerk had achieved that feat with "The Model" in 1982 and Boney M with "Rivers Of Babylon" and "Mary's Boy Child" in 1978.
