Title: Taichung Baseball Field


The Taichung Baseball Field () is a multi-purpose stadium in North District, Taichung, Taiwan. Built in 1935 during the Taiwan under Japanese rule era, this stadium has been repeatedly refurbished and currently can seat 8,500 people. This stadium has been the home of professional baseball teams such as Jungo Bears (1993–1995), Sinon Bears (first half 1996), Sinon Bulls(second half 1996–2012) of Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) and Taichung Agan(1997–2002) of Taiwan Major League (TML).

This stadium has long been a part of the National Taiwan College of Physical Education's campus and caused certain inconvenience when hosting professional baseball games. A new baseball stadium, the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium, opened in November 2006 to host the 2006 Intercontinental Cup, and it became the new home of the Sinon Bulls starting in 2010 season.

Taichung Baseball Field no longer hosts professional baseball games and is only used for educational and training purposes.
