Title: Lamone



Lamone is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Lamone is first mentioned in 854 as Namonni. In 1295 it was mentioned as Lamono.

A prehistoric stone bowl was discovered on San Zeno hill. The first records of the village record properties and feudal rights in Lamone in the 9th century. These rights were probably held by the Benedictine Abbey of St. Ambrose in Milan and Como Cathedral. In the 15th century, the Duke of Milan acquired some of these rights. Other landholders included; in 1423, the hospital of S. Maria of Lugano, the S. Giuseppe Hospital and in 1514, the monastery of Santa Maria del Carmelo in Piacenza. In 1529, the rights of San Giuseppe and the Monastery of Santa Maria del Carmelo transferred to the Laghi family of Lugano.

The parish of Lamone (which also included Cadempino) is acknowledged as an independent parish in 1468. In 1758 it was elevated to a provostship. The Church of S. Andrea is mentioned for the first time in 1468, but it is probably from the 12th to the 13th century. In 1612 and again in the 19th century it was rebuilt. The bell tower dates from the Roman era. Next to the Oratory of St. Zeno, from the late 15th century, are the remains of a hermitage from 854.

The grazing rights that Lamone and Cadempino shared in the alpine meadows of Traverno and Guzzala, were granted to Isone in 1507. centuries of border disputes with Cadempino were finally resolved in 1887. Formerly the inhabitants of the village lived on agriculture and from money sent back by emigrants. A mill is first mentioned in 1619. Between the 18th century and about 1950 there was a sawmill and a sand quarry at Valeggia. The bridge over the Vedeggio river in Ostarietta was built in 1806–12 when the Lugano-Cadenazzo road was built. The bridge connects Lamone with the major roads and residential area on the right bank of the river. The river was redirected and put into a channel between 1906 and 1911. The village train station was built in 1923. Most of the industrial and commercial enterprises are concentrated in this flat area, along the river and the highway. The industrial growth was responsible for a large increase in population between 1950 and 1970.
