Title: List of Texas hurricanes (1980–present)



From 1980 to the present, 81 tropical or subtropical cyclones affected the U.S. state of Texas. According to David Roth of the Weather Prediction Center, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about three times every four years, and on any  segment of the coastline a hurricane makes landfall about once every six years.

The most active month is September, with 21 total storms, while no recorded storms have affected Texas during the months of December through May. While the most intense storm in terms of barometric pressure is Hurricane Allen in 1980, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 caused the most fatalities and damages, with $125 billion in Texas. The first storm to impact the state during the period is also Hurricane Allen in August 1980, with the most recent being Hurricane Harvey on August 25, 2017. In terms of wind speed, Hurricane Harvey is the strongest storm to affect the state since 1980, producing maximum sustained winds equivalent to  status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.

During the 1980s, multiple tropical cyclones affected the state, of which six made landfall as hurricanes; three made landfall as major hurricanes. Hurricane Alicia is the most destructive hurricane of the decade, severely impacting the Greater Houston area. The names of all three major hurricanes that impacted Texas during the 1980s were later retired by the World Meteorological Organization. In contrast to the 1980s, during the 1990s only one hurricane, Hurricane Bret, made landfall on the Texas coast. In the next decade five hurricanes would make landfall on Texas. Hurricane Ike, the second costliest hurricane to impact Texas, made landfall during the decade. Other notable systems include Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Rita.

*July 30, 2011 – Tropical Storm Don makes landfall near Baffin Bay, Texas before quickly dissipating. The storm produces minimal rainfall in extreme southern Texas, peaking at  in Bay City. Cotton farms benefit from the minimal rainfall.
*Early-September 2011 – The outer bands of Tropical Storm Lee cause light rain in eastern Texas, peaking at  in Nederland. Despite the light rainfall, strong winds further inland help ignite numerous wildfires throughout the state. One of the fires, the Bastrop County Complex fire, destroys 1,700 homes and businesses, becoming the most destructive wildfire in Texas history.
*August 31, 2012 – Outer rainbands associated with Hurricane Isaac cause slight rainfall in East Texas, peaking at around  near Galveston Bay. Strong winds associated with Isaac's thunderstorms knock down many trees in Trinity County, where wind gusts peak at an estimated .
*September 29, 2012 – Moisture associated with the remnants of Hurricane Miriam and Tropical Storm Norman brings light rainfall over areas of Texas, slightly alleviating drought conditions. Rainfall in the state measures , causing some flash flooding. Combined with a surface trough, the moisture generates severe thunderstorms which later coalesce into a squall line, bringing strong winds which cause numerous reports of window damage. A weather station near Paducah records a peak wind gust of .
*Mid-September 2013 – As Hurricane Ingrid passes to the south, its outer rainbands drop isolated areas of heavy rainfall across South Texas. Rainfall totals from the bands peak at approximately  near the Texas border with Mexico.
*September 3, 2014 – Despite making landfall near Tampico, Mexico, the outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Dolly traverse South Texas, producing rainfall totals peaking at  in Hidalgo County. After dissipating, moisture from the remnant system causes additional showers in the area. Urban flooding as a result of poor water drainage occurs in Brownsville, Edinburg, and McAllen. However, the heavy rainfall helps to alleviate some drought conditions in South Texas.
*September 20, 2014 – Flooding associated with the remnants of Hurricane Odile kill one sheriff's deputy in Austin.

The Aransas County Airport in Rockport registers a peak wind gust of  within Harvey's eyewall. Extensive wind damage occurs in Rockport and Fulton, with many roofs blown off and walls torn apart; widespread damage also befalls nearby communities. Storm surge inundates areas along San Antonio and Hynes bays under as much as  of water, resulting in major flood conditions. Weak steering currents cause Harvey to slowly meander along the Texas Coastal Plain for several days, subjecting large swaths of the region to prolonged and torrential rainfall from the storm's rainbands. The rains constitute the most prolific rainfall event associated with a tropical cyclone in U.S. history, with the peak rainfall total of  near Nederland setting the national record for the largest rainfall total measured in connection to a tropical cyclone; at least 18 observing sites report amounts exceeding the previous record for the contiguous U.S. of . The unprecedented scale of the rainfall in both extent and magnitude causes catastrophic flooding, displacing approximately 1.8 million people. Bayous in the Greater Houston area rapidly rise and overrun their banks, prompting evacuations and submerging parts of Houston; 60,049 residents are rescued. Parts of all 22 major freeways in the metropolitan area suffer inundation. Tens of thousands of homes in Southeast Texas are inundated by record flooding. In total, Harvey's effects destroy 16,930 homes and damage 290,063 homes. At least 68 deaths are directly attributed to Harvey's forces, making it the deadliest hurricane in Texas since 1919; an additional 35 deaths are indirectly attributed to Harvey. The NOAA estimates a $125 billion damage toll for Harvey, making it the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history when adjusting for inflation and the costliest hurricane in Texas history.
*September 17–19, 2019 – Tropical Storm Imelda makes landfall near Freeport, Texas with winds of . The slow and erratic movement of the tropical cyclone produces widespread and catastrophic flooding across much of southeastern Texas.

*July 25, 2020 – Hurricane Hanna makes landfall roughly  north-northwest of Port Mansifeld with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Texas incurs over $1.1 billion in damage, sustaining heavy losses to crops in the Rio Grande Valley and widespread power outages affecting some 200,000 people. Five indirect deaths are attributed to the storm, including four from carbon monoxide poisoning in Edinburg. Rainfall totals of  occur across the Rio Grande Valley, punctuated by a peak total of  near Santa Rosa. The heavy rains trigger flash floods and prompt water rescues in Hidalgo and Cameron counties.
*August 26, 2020 – the western extent of Hurricane Laura impacts Southeast Texas, bringing  wind gusts and leaving Orange hardest-hit. More than 160,000 energy customers lose power, including about 90 percent of Orange County. Six people die of carbon monoxide poisoning in Laura's aftermath and an additional 18 people are treated for carbon monoxide injuries.
* Mid-September 2020 – the slow-moving Tropical Storm Beta causes extensive rainfall across Southeast Texas, with a station in Brookside registering a peak accumulation of . Significant flooding occurs in southern parts of Houston with damage to at least 20–25 homes; one person drowns in Brays Bayou.
