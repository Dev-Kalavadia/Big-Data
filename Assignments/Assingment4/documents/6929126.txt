The weekly magazine and culture lifestyle program showcases American and foreign-born Latinos making a positive impact in American society.

Segments from the show can also be seen on the Internet and the show is broadcast internationally in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and in parts of Canada bordering the U.S. The show often airs in tandem with its sister program LatiNation and has also spawned a series of specials titled American Latino Presents and The American Latino Awards.

== Origins ==
American Latino TV was formerly known as Urban Latino TV and was originally produced by the AIM Tell-A-Vision Group (AIM TV), a New York City-based production and syndication company. AIM TV is a division of Artist and Idea Management and helped establish the business model of producing English language content for U.S. born Latinos beginning in 2001.

AIM TV was established in February 2000 by Robert G. Rose with the help of his production partner, Renzo Devia. AIM TV was the first television company to successfully produce, distribute and syndicate television programming targeting U.S. born Latinos, helping to spawn an industry that had not existed before (TV content in English, targeted to young, mostly U.S. born Latinos). 65% of U.S. Latinos are U.S. born according to U.S. Census data, but rarely if ever watch Spanish-language TV (according to Tomas Rivera Policy Inst. 1999).

In January 2008, the syndicated programs and the American Latino brand name were acquired by LATV Networks, the nation's first bilingual entertainment/music network distributed via digital multicast. The company gradually moved production to Los Angeles, California, where the show continues production of original episodes.

The broadcast syndication division (American Latino Syndication) continues to operate under the LATV Networks umbrella with sales and production offices located in New York City and Los Angeles, California.
