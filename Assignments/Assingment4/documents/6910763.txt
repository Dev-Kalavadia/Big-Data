==Critical reception==

Firewater was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on nine reviews.

Soren Baker of Los Angeles Times called it "a rare modern-day rap album that is as fun as it is good". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club resumed: "far from classic, but pretty damn fun nonetheless". Spin reviewer described the album as "like your favorite dive bar, it feels uncomfortably familiar". 

In mixed reviews, AllMusic's Andy Kellman noticed: "what prevents the album from being on par with the likes of 21 & Over and Coast II Coast is that the MCs have slowed a little with age". Adrian Covert of Prefix magazine wrote: "the members of Tha Alkaholiks may not have wrapped up their stellar career with the bang many had hoped for, but I'll still drink to this". Eric Neigher of Slant magazine stated "much of Firewater has a blast-from-the-past feel". Michael Frauenhofer of PopMatters wrote: "it may not be their best album, but where it doesnâ€™t really add to their legacy, neither does it really tarnish". NOW magazine reviewer found out that "their beats and rhymes reflect none of the punchliney fun they used to have".
