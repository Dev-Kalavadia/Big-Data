===Airports in East Timor===
* Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport formerly known as Comoro Airport, is situated in Dili and 6 kilometres west of Dili city centre. The airport serves as the main international airport for Timor-Leste. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic between 2020-2021, flights into and out of Timor-Leste through Dili international airport were restricted. It has an 1850 m length and 30 m wide runway. Due to the runway length, the maximum size of aircraft capable of landing is B737 equivalent. 
In October 2021, the Asian Development Bank approved a $135 million loan for the expansion of Dili Airport. This project aims to improve facilities at Dili Airport by extending the airport runway to meet international safety standards and constructing a new air traffic control tower (ATCT), taxiways, aprons, and aeronautical ground lighting system support the upgraded runway.
