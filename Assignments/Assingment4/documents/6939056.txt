==Legal actions==
The company was sued by the Federal Trade Commission in 2003 for false advertising.

===2003 FTC injunction===
Mayo Clinic published a study in 2002 showing definitively that Q-Ray bracelets have no effect upon muscle pain relative to the placebo effect. This study prompted the Federal Trade Commission to impose an injunction on QT Inc. the following year, preventing any further claims regarding pain relief.

===2006 follow-up case===
On September 8, 2006, a federal judge ordered QT Inc. to pay back $22.5 million "in ill-gotten gains." The defendants could owe even more—up to $87 million—depending on how many Q-Ray customers seek refunds.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Morton Denlow wrote a 136-page opinion and concluded: "Park made up the theory that the bracelet works like acupuncture or Eastern medicine. He has no testing or studies to support his theory." Thus, the theory was made "...to defraud consumers out of millions of dollars by preying on their desire to find a simple solution to alleviate their physical pain."Court Rules In FTC's Favor In Q-Ray Bracelet Case ; Federal Trade Commission; September 2009 article; retrieved .
