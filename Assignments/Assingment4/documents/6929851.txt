Title: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation



Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation (or MGM Animation for short) was the animation division of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer motion picture studio in Hollywood, California, that specializes in animated productions for theatrical features and television. It was established in 1993 and primarily involved in producing children's entertainment based upon MGM's ownership of properties, such as The Pink Panther, The Lionhearts, The Secret of NIMH, and All Dogs Go to Heaven. 

The founders, Paul Sabella and Jonathan Dern, left the company in 1999 and founded SD Entertainment. The studio has been dormant in 2002, ever since then.
