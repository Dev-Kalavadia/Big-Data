Title: Civis Media Prize
The Civis Media Prize for Integration honors people for  radio and television broadcasting projects that promote peaceful coexistence within the European immigration community.

Promoting understanding between peoples of different cultures and religious beliefs, revealing the complex causes of violence and demonstrating the successful mastering of conflict across national borders, can only succeed if the media report to the public about these complex topics realistically and informatively. Fighting racism and discrimination is not exclusively a national task.

The Civis media prize is awarded as a European television prize and as a German-language radio prize in EU and Switzerland. With the Young Civis media prize there is a sponsorship prize for young journalists as well as students and graduates of the film and media colleges, who are no older than 32 years of age. The CIVIS Online Media Prize will recognize journalistically-designed websites on the theme of integration and cultural diversity. The Civis prize is endowed with a total of 46,000 Euros. The entry is open to all programme contributions which satisfy the conditions of participation. It is presented on May every year and the prize-giving ceremony will be broadcast on radio and television.
