Jacopo da Empoli (30 April 1551 – 30 September 1640) was an Italian Florentine Reformist painter.

Born in Florence as Jacopo Chimenti (Empoli being the birthplace of his father), he worked mostly in his native city.  He apprenticed under Maso da San Friano. Like his contemporary in Counter-Maniera (Counter-Mannerism), Santi di Tito, he moved into a style often more crisp, less contorted, and less crowded than mannerist predecessors like Vasari. He collaborated with Alessandro Tiarini in some projects. His younger brother, Domenico Chimenti, born in Empoli, was also a painter.Catalogo dei quadri che si conservano nella Pinacoteca Vannucci in Perugia, by Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, (1903) page 61. Among his pupils were Felice Ficherelli, Giovanni Battista Brazzè (Il Bigio),
 Giovanni Battista Vanni, and  Virgilio Zaballi.Hobbes J.R. p. 81

Finally, working in a thematic often shunned by Florentine painters, after the 1620s he completed a series of exceptional still-life paintings.
