Title: Andrew Lewis (boxer)


Andrew Lewis (December 14, 1970 – May 4, 2015) was a Guyanese professional boxer in the Middleweight division and the WBA World Welterweight Champion. He also competed in the men's welterweight event at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Pro career==
Nicknamed "Six Heads", Lewis turned pro in 1993.

===WBA Welterweight Championship===
Andrew beat James Page in 2001 to capture the Vacant WBA Welterweight Title.  Due to his exciting style and power in both hands, Lewis quickly became a popular fighter on HBO. After defending the title against Larry Marks, he took on Ricardo Mayorga and the bout ended in the 2nd round and was ruled a No contest due to a nasty cut on Lewis caused by accidental headbutt.  Lewis's lost the title in a rematch to Mayorga in 2002 via 5th-round TKO.

===WBO Welterweight Championship===
In 2003 Lewis challenged WBO Welterweight Champion Antonio Margarito, but was TKO'd in the 2nd round.

===Guyanese Light Middleweight Title===
From 2005 to 2007 Lewis battled Denny Dalton in a series of 3 fights for the Guyanese Light Middleweight Title.  These fights are most notable due to the controversial and bizarre nature of the ending of the second fight.  Ahead on points in the 7th Round Lewis retired from the fight due to an extreme need to defecate blamed on consumption of a pre-fight milkshake.

Lewis returned to the ring almost 12 months to the day from this embarrassment to defeat Dalton and claim the Guyanese Light Middleweight Title.  This would prove to be the final victory of his career, which ended in October 2008 when he dropped a split decision to Howard Eastman.

He condemned the World Trade Center attacks"
