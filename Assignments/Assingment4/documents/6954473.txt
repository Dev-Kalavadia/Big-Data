==History==

===World War I===
No. 245 Squadron was formed on 20 August 1918 from No. 426 and No. 427 Flight at Fishguard. It flew Short 184 on anti-submarine patrols over the southern Irish Sea. The squadron disbanded on 19 May 1919.

===World War II===
As No. 245 (Northern Rhodesian) Squadron, the squadron was reformed at RAF Leconfield on 30 October 1939 equipped with Bristol Blenheim  light bombers, and from January 1940, Fairey Battle light bombers. Both of these types were replaced by Hurricanes in March 1940 and in May it moved to RAF Drem in Scotland. However, during the Dunkirk evacuation it operated a detachment from RAF Hawkinge, but in July it was transferred to RAF AldergroveRobinson 1999, p. 276. in Northern Ireland, where it remained throughout the Battle of Britain on defensive duties. In July 1941 it moved to RAF Ballyhalbert and remained there until September 1941, when it returned to England and began offensive sweeps. On 19 August 1942, the squadron took part in a preparatory attack as part of the Dieppe Raid. Ten aircraft took off at 0445 from RAF Shoreham. Three aircraft failed to return, and of the remaining seven, only one was serviceable. In January 1943 it moved to Scotland again, where it began converting to Typhoons, taking these back down south in March to RAF Westhampnett. The squadron was then allocated to the 2nd Tactical Air Force on its formation in June 1943 and soon began attacking enemy lines of communication and other suitable targets in preparation for Operation Overlord. From April it began using rocket projectiles and on 27 June 1944, it moved onto the continent, from where it continued to support the Allied advanceGolley 1986, "The Day of the Typhoon" through France, the Low Countries and into Germany.
