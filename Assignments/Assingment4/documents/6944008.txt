Title: MI AC PR mineThe MI AC PR are a series of French minimum metal blast resistant mine anti-tank blast mines. The mines can be laid by hand or automatically from the Matenin mine laying system at a rate of 500 per hour. The mines use a clockwork arming delay, which can also self neutralize the mine after a set period. They have a secondary fuze well in the base that allows anti-handling devices to be fitted.

The mine is still in production and is in service with the French army, as well as a number of others.
