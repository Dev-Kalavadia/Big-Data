Title: Jeongja station

Jeongja (formerly Baekgung station) is a station on the Bundang Line and the Shinbundang Line, an express subway in South Korea.

It was the southern terminus of the Shinbundang Line, between October 2011 and January 2016, when the Shinbundang Line extended to Gwanggyo station. However, it still exists as a divide in terms of fare since riders need to pay an extra charge of 300 won (on top of the 900 won charge of using the Shinbundang Line) when crossing this station, due to the owners of Phase 1 and 2 being different. This rule only applies to the Shinbundang Line - Riders of the Bundang Line pay the normal minimum fare of 1,250 won.
