Title: Polow da Don



Jamal Fincher Jones (born October 15, 1977, or 1978), known professionally as Polow da Don, is an American record producer and rapper.

Jones has produced a variety of singles for a number of artists, including "Anaconda" by Nicki Minaj (2014), "Love In This Club" by Usher (2008), "Buttons" by the Pussycat Dolls (2006), "Forever" by Chris Brown (2008), "Baby By Me" by 50 Cent (2009), "Throw Some D's" by Rich Boy (2007), "Promise" by Ciara (2006), and "John" by Lil Wayne (2011), among others. In addition, Jones served as a producer for artists on his own label imprint under Interscope Records, Zone 4. Jones is also known for being a charismatic hype man for his records, with his vocals present on most of his productions.

Jones began his career as a rapper in the late 90s, leaving college to pursue a rap career with the group Jim Crow. The group signed to Sony Music Entertainment in 1999 where they released two albums—Crow's Nest (1999) and Right Quick (2001)—before being dropped. Although disappointed, Jones formed a Southern hip hop group with Bubba Sparxxx, Sean P, Pastor Troy, G Rock, and Timbaland. However, they split up without any releases.Hope, Clover (June 2007).
