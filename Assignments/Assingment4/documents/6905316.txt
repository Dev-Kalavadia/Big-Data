Title: Ganmodoki



 is a fried tofu fritter made with vegetables, such as carrots, lotus roots and burdock. It may also contain egg. Ganmodoki means pseudo-goose ( + ). This is because ganmodoki is said to taste like goose; compare mock turtle soup. Ganmodoki is also called ganmo for short.

In the Edo period, ganmodoki was a stir-fried konjac dish. A dish similar to the ganmodoki today was made by wrapping chopped up vegetables in tofu (much like a manjū) and deep frying it.

In Western Japan, Ganmodoki is called hiryōzu, hiryuzu or hirōsu, from the Portuguese word filhós or Spanish fillos.
