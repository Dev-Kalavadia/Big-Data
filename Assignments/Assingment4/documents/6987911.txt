Title: Ulmus 'Morton Red Tip'


Ulmus 'Morton Red Tip' (selling name ) is a hybrid cultivar raised by the Morton Arboretum from an open pollination of Ulmus 'Morton'. The tree has occasionally been reported as a hybrid of  with the Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila, an error probably owing to the commercial propagation of the tree by grafting onto U. pumila rootstocks.
Tested in the US National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University,  averaged a survival rate of 77.5% after 10 years.

==Description==
 has a graceful, vase-shaped habit resembling the American Elm Ulmus americana with foliage tinged red on emergence.

==Pests and diseases==
Although resistant to Dutch elm disease in the US,  is very susceptible to the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola,McPherson, G. et al. (2008).

==Cultivation==
 is very cold hardy; in artificial freezing tests at the arboretumShirazi, A. M. & Ware, G. H. (2004). Evaluation of New Elms from China for Cold Hardiness in Northern Latitudes. International Symposium on Asian Plant Diversity & Systematics 2004, Sakura, Japan. the LT50 (temp. at which 50% of tissues die) was found to be −31 °C. However, the tree is notorious for its stem breakage owing to narrow crotch angles and included bark; in trials at the University of Minnesota it had the unhappy distinction of being the worst of 17 cultivars for breakage.Giblin, C. P. & Gillman, J. H. (2006). Elms for the Twin Cities: A Guide for Selection and Maintenance. University of Minnesota. The tree is currently being evaluated in the National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University.

 is being promoted by the Chicagoland Grows corporation but is not widely available in the United States. Very rare in Europe, it is not known (2016) to have been introduced to Australasia.

==Etymology==
The name Danada in  is a conflation of the given names of Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice, whose eponymous Foundation helped sponsor the elm breeding program at the Morton Arboretum.
