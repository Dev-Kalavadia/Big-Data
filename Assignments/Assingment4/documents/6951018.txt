==History==
Piazzogna is first mentioned in 1337 as Piazognia.  It was mentioned again between 1542 and 1546 as part of the award given by the local bailiff during arbitration.  The arbitration dealt with the rights of neighboring villages to use alpine meadows.  Piazzogna belonged first to the municipality and parish of Vira, but by 1704 it had become an independent municipality.  However, it didn't become an independent political municipality until 1803.

The original village church of S. Antonio Abate was probably built in the Middle Ages in the romanesque style.  However it fell into ruin and collapsed between the 17th and 18th centuries.  The parish built a new church in 1752.  In the wake of the village's independence from the parish of Vira in 1837, this church was expanded several times in the 19th century.

The hamlet of Alabardia, once part of the parish of San Nazzaro, became widely known in 1783 as the center of Horace-Bénédict de Saussure barometric experiments conducted around Lake Maggiore.
