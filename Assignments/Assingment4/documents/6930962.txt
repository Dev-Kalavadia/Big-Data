Title: Ready or Not (Fugees song)



"Ready or Not" is a song by American hip-hop group Fugees, from their second studio album, The Score (1996). The song contains a sample of "Boadicea" (1987) by Irish singer Enya, and its chorus is based on "Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)" by the Delfonics.

"Ready or Not" was met with positive reviews from music critics upon its release. The song was not released as a commercial single in the United States, making it ineligible to appear on the Billboard Hot 100. However, "Ready or Not" topped the charts in Iceland; and became the Fugees' second chart-topping song on the UK Singles Chart, following "Killing Me Softly". Additionally, it was one of the best-selling songs of 1996 in the United Kingdom; and is among the top-selling hip-hop songs of all the in the region.

The accompanying music video was directed by film director Marcus Nispel. Several music journalists have cited it as the first rap video with a seven figure budget, with it being reported to have cost approximately 1.3 million dollars at the time, making it one of the most expensive music videos ever.

"Ready or Not" was placed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the 'Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll'.

==Background==
The song contains a sample of "Boadicea" by New-Age singer, Enya from her first solo album, Enya (1987). Enya considered suing the Fugees because they had sampled "Boadicea" without her permission. Enya stated, "We were actually on the verge of suing them because of the copyright infringement, because they just didn't approach us. It was a case of, I wasn't featured at all on the credits and it [the sample] was very much a part of the song." However, the singer reached an agreement with the Fugees to an out-of-court settlement after she realized that their music wasn't gangsta rap.Rolling Stone. 20 Great Albums Turning 20 in 2016. Rolling Stone. January 12, 2016. Retrieved on March 27, 2016. According to Wyclef, "Luckily when Enya heard everything, she was like, ‘This is different’ and she gave us a pass – which she don’t even need to do." The situation was a learning experience for the group, who at the time were unaware of copyright clearance and unfamiliar with publishing procedures.

The song's chorus is based on "Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)" by the Delfonics, which was an addition suggested by Wyclef Jean. Reflecting on the recording process, Pras said: "At one point, the group had disbanded. Lauryn Hill had left the group at this point and we didn't know what we were going to do. She calls me and says, 'Listen, I'm going to come down to the studio and I'm going to lay down a reference for you guys, a hook. I give you permission to use my hook, my voice, but I don't want to be a part of this group anymore.' I said, 'Fair enough. No problem.' She said, 'Make sure certain people are not around when I'm there.' I said, 'No problem.' She's laying the reference for 'Ready or Not' and then she goes into the bridge and she's crying. I see her crying. She stops and says, 'I can't do this anymore,' and leaves. A couple months later she re-joins the group. She said, 'Let's do 'Ready or Not' again 'cause I was crying. It was emotional.' She goes in the studio to do 'Ready or Not' again. She was in there five hours doing the hook. Every hit is incredible. But we go back and say, 'There's something about that reference. I don't know if we can touch that.' We end up keeping the reference. That's what the world has come to hear. There's something about that record… That's magic."

==Critical reception==
Larry Flick from Billboard felt the song was "far more representative of the act's vibe", and that "this cut nicely illustrates its lyrical strength as well as its talent for switching from smooth soul singing to sharp rapping within the space of a few seconds." Gil L. Robertson IV from Cash Box named it a "standout track" of The Score album. Damien Mendis from Music Week's RM Dance Update rated it five out of five, commenting, "New Jersey's pride and joy retum with a soulful blend of rap, R&B and reggae. The original Radio version taken from their gold-selling album [...] already won fans due to its hypnotic use of The Delfonics' number 41 hit of 1971 'Ready Or Not, Here I Come (Can't Hide From Love)'. The promos even adopt the original Bell label logo colour and style." David Fricke from Rolling Stone remarked "the sweet heat of Lauryn Hill's alto".Fricke, David (December 26, 1996-January 9, 1997). "The year in recordings". Rolling Stone. Issue 750/751. A reviewer from Spin magazine described the song as "an eerily ambient flow of confused musings (Jean), confident harmonies (Hill), and immigrant pride (Michel), tapped insistently into your consciousness by a simple snare beat."

=== Recognition ===

==Music video==

The video featured helicopters, explosions, sharks, chase scenes, and a price tag of 1.3 million US dollars. In justifying the cost, Pras told Vibe "People want to see drama, man. You figure: A kid pays sixteen dollars for your CD. Let him see a good video."Gimme the Loot Vibe, February 1998

== Legacy ==
Philosopher Alison Stone credits "Ready or Not" as one of the earliest examples of a rap song with combined rapped and melodic elements in its vocal parts or with a "straightforwardly melodic" chorus. Lauryn Hill's verse in particular has been noted as precursor for modern melodic rap from singing-rappers like Drake and Young Thug. Hill's verse saw her addressing misogyny in the male dominated hip-hop scene, along with taking aim at gangsta rappers at the height of gangsta rap, while carving out a lane for The Fugees in alternative hip-hop.

"Ready or Not" has often received praise for its strategic use of sampling. The song further exposed music from Enya and The Delfonics to a new generation of hip hop audiences through sampling, with the song "Boadicea" by Enya being sampled numerous times by other artists following the release of "Ready or Not". Music Journalist Chris Tart of HotNewHipHop proclaimed "Most hip-hop songs derived from something from the parent generation, and this one is no exception. The creative juice that melted the Delfonics, Enya and some Brooklyn-based refugees is very much a cause for celebration. "Ready or Not "; is one of the greatest moments in rap history."
