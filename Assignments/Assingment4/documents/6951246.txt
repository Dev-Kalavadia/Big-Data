Title: Minusio

Minusio is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
In the Ceresole section, a significant Iron Age necropolis (c. 6th-5th century BC) was discovered.  It held about 20 graves and rich grave goods.  Nearby, several Roman graveyards from the 1st and 2nd Centuries AD, were discovered.  The Roman graveyards are among the most important in Ticino because of the complexity of the system and the amount of material.  A discovery in 1936 found about 30 graves.  In the Roman era, Minusio was a minor settlement outside of Muralto, which was the center of the Roman presence in the Locarno area.

Minusio is first mentioned in 1061 as Menuxio, though this comes from a copy of the original from 1402.  In 1200 it was mentioned as Menuxio.  It used to be known by its German name, Maniss, though this is no longer used. During the Middle Ages, it was a village, which, together with Brione sopra Minusio and Mergoscia formed a Vicinanza.  By the time that the village laws were written down in 1313, Minusio had separated from Mergoscia.  Brione dissolved as an independent village gradually until 1479 when it ceased to exist independently.  Traces of the old vicinanza remained until 1952 in the so-called Comunella dei tre comuni which held common property and court rights.  Minusio owned fishing and grazing rights in the Magadino valley, and shared ownership of the Terricciole region with Mergoscia and Locarno until 1920.  The town mayor was picked by the four squadre (town sections) of Rivapiana, Cadogno, Frizzi and Mezzo, each in turn.  Between 1803 and 1839, Minusio was the capital of the district of Navegna.  In 1839, it supported the anti-Confederation side in the constitutional struggles.  When they lost the conflict, it lost not only its role as district capital to Tenero, but was also occupied by the military.

The town church was led by a chaplain under the archpriest of S. Vittore in Locarno.  The village of Mondacce became part of the parish of Gordola in 1698 and then in 1921, the parish of Tenero.  Minusio became an independent parish in 1798, and in 1949 was granted a provost.  The parish church of San Rocco was first built at the end of the 15th century, but was completely rebuilt in 1795–1801.  The oldest religious building in the municipality is the Church of San Quirico in Rivapiana which was first mentioned in 1313.  In the late 18th century an extension was added to the church.  It contains remains of frescoes from the 13th-14th and the 15th-16th Centuries as well as a fragment of a Gallo-Roman votive altar.  The church bell tower originally functioned as a guard tower.  The church of S. Maria delle Grazie was erected at the beginning of the 17th century.  The Holy Cross Chapel was built in the 18th century.  The chapel of Santa Maria dei Sette Dolori (1630) is attached to the Casa di Ferro, a military base, which had built by Peter Ammann a Pro in 1558.

In the 18th and 19th Centuries several notable villas were built, though some of them have been demolished or have collapsed.  However, several Art Nouveau villas from the 20th century are still occupied.  The Villa La Baronata in Mappo dates from the 17th century and in the 19th century housed several famous refugees.  The Elisarion villa was built in 1925-29 as a residence and temple.  It was taken over in 1981 by the municipality and set up a cultural center.

===La Baronata===

It was here that Giovanni Antonio Marcacci (1769–1854) built La Baronata as a summer house. The building was bought by Mikhail Bakunin in 1873 with money he obtained from Carlo Cafiero. They planned that possession of the building would give Bakunin the status of a land-owner, helping him gain Swiss citizenship, and to provide premises for storing arms and providing accommodation in aid of the anarchist international. A second building was erected, a lake dug and a number of fruit trees planted. With the addition of a cow, a carriage and two horses, a milkmaid and a groom were employed. When Bakunin's wife, Antonia Kwiatkowska, was on her way there in July 1874, her lover, Carlo Gambuzzi informed her that the house had been bought through the abuse of Cafiero's generosity. On her arrival, Bakunin originally denied this and at first persuaded Cafiero to agree. However, on reflection, Cafiero told Bakunin on 15 July that he had indeed abused their friendship and that he would not spend any more money, thought or energy on La Baronata, rather devoting the fraction left of his inheritance on buying weapons for the proposed revolution in Italy. "The days following the 15th were a veritable hell" Bakunin later wrote. On 25 July Bakunin signed over the deeds of the building to Cafiero and resolved to die on the barricades in Bologna.

Following a career as a revolutionary anarchist, Cafiero suffered a mental breakdown whilst in prison in Italy in 1882. He returned briefly to La Baronata, but went back to Italy once again in 1883.
