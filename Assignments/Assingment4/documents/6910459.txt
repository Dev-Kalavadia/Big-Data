A 16-year-old boy, Ankit, died after taking a plunge into a swimming pool in a Punjabi Bagh club in West Delhi on Tuesday, June 11, 2003. Apparently, there were four life guards and a supervisor present around the pool when Ankit drowned.

The victim was rushed to Agrasen hospital, where he was declared brought dead. According to deputy commissioner of police (licensing) G C Dwivedi, the club''s licence has been cancelled. "We won''t allow swimming in the club till the investigations are completed," said Dwivedi. The incident took place around 7.30 pm. Son of a businessman, Ankit was a student of Hansraj Model school and had passed his Class X examinations this year. He was a regular visitor of the club, the police said. Deputy Commissioner of police (west) Satish Golcha said: "The boy had gone to the pool alone. Five life guards were present on the spot. First-aid equipment was there as well." According to the police, four life guards are deployed in the evening and three in the morning at the pool, which is 16 feet deep. According to sources, there are more than 120 swimming pools in the city with a proper licence. But the actual number of swimming pools in the city is much more. The defaulter list included some educational institutions as well. The set of guidelines for maintaining a swimming pool is fairly comprehensive and stringent. Every pool must employ an instructor with adequate knowledge of first aid and artificial respiration. The instructor has to be present till the pool remains open.
