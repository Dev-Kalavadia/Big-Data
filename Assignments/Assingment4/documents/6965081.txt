Title: The Happy Day


The Happy Day is a musical comedy in two acts by Seymour Hicks, with music by Sidney Jones and Paul Rubens, and lyrics by Adrian Ross and Rubens. It was produced by George Edwardes's company (by the estate's executor, Robert Evett) and was directed by Evett. The story concerns a royal couple who dislike each other but ultimately fall in love. A masquerade scene provides opportunities for mistaken identity.

The musical opened at Daly's Theatre in London on 13 May 1916 and ran for 241 performances.  It starred Winifred Barnes, José Collins and Arthur Wontner, who played the Ruritanian prince. Later Bertram Wallis joined the cast.

==Background==
The Happy Day opened during World War I in the same year as three other tremendously successful shows in London: Chu Chin Chow, Theodore & Co and The Bing Boys are Here.  Audiences, including servicemen on leave, wanted light and uplifting entertainment during the war, and these shows delivered it.  The show was Jones's last success. A review in The Illustrated London News commented that the costumes were "sumptuous" and praised the comedy and the music of the piece, as well as the cast, especially Collins "with her attractive voice and picturesque personality.""The Happy Day, at Daly's", The Illustrated London News, Vol. 58, p. 638, 20 May 1916, accessed 18 December 2013

Two of the popular songs from The Happy Day were "Bohemia" and "I Don't Seem to Want You When You're With Me".
