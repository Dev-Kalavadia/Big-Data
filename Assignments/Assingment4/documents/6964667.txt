The band began life in 1870 as the band of the 34th Ontario Regiment, and was a traditional Military band."34th Regiment Band at Niagara-on-the-Lake Camp, June 14, 1905". Archives of the Whitby Public Library. In 1920, the regimental band merged with the Oshawa Citizens' Band, to become the Oshawa Civic and Regimental Band."A century and a half of music-making for Oshawa Civic Band". Oshawa This Week, Jul 20, 2016 As time passed the band evolved into its current configuration.  In 1942, a bandshell and a bandroom were built in Oshawa's Memorial Park for use by the group, with the sponsorship of industrialist Robert McLaughlin."Music in Oshawa". The Canadian Encyclopedia,  Margaret Drynan, 02/07/2006

===Civilian service===
Official ties with the regiment were ended in 1968 due to budget cuts by the federal government as a result of the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces. After this, Naval Lieutenant Bill Askew intervened in the destruction of the band's history, resulting in it officially assuming the name of Oshawa Civic band and has since become incorporated. Many of the former regimental bandsmen continue to play with the Civic Band today. The band performs regular outdoor concerts in Oshawa"Oshawa Civic Band @ Memorial Park". Snapd Oshawa. during the summer months, as well as at special events and ceremonies. The band has often performed in concert with other musical groups, including the Festival Singers"Festival Singers hold cabaret night".
