Title: National Research University of Electronic Technology





National Research University of Electronic TechnologyEnglish official name for international usage.Contact information and Charter of MIET  (, lit. National Research University "Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology"Direct translation of Russian official name.) is a Russian technical university in the field of microelectronics, information and computer technologies and one of 29 National Research Universities. University was founded in 1965 and is based in Zelenograd, Moscow (the Soviet Union's center for electronic and microelectronic design and engineering).

== Architecture ==
The University complex was designed by the architects Felix Novikov and Grigory Saevich and built in 1967-1971. The complex has some similarity with the complex of the Finnish Helsinki University of Technology, built in 1954-1969 by architect Alvar Aalto. The main administrative building (#1) with library and five large lecture halls, the assembly hall (#2) with dining hall, two academic buildings (#3 and #4), and sports complex (#5) of multipurpose arena and swimming pool were built of red bricks and connected by passages in united microtown.

The decoration of the exterior walls of the library is the huge white bas-relief (970 m², all four walls) "The Becoming of a Homo sapiens" (, Stanovlenie cheloveka razumnogo) completed in 1974 by the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny.

The main facades of the main administrative building and the assembly hall are turned to Shokin's Square (), named after Alexander Shokin (1909-1988), the twice Hero of Socialist Labour, the USSR Minister of Electronic Industry, one of founders of Zelenograd and MIET. The main MIET entrance is decorated by clock designed by the artist Sergey Chekhov and the sculptor Valery Tyulin and placed in the white tower. The sound system of the clock mimics striking clock (one bell stroke every 15 minutes, and X strokes of the bell at X o'clock sharp).

There is Shokin's bust in the park near the square. There are also Skokin's and Presnukhin's (the first rector) memorial plates respectively on the right and left sides of the main administrative building facade (if we are looking on the facade).
