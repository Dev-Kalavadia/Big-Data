==Celine Dion version==


In 1987, Celine Dion recorded a French-language version of "Just Have a Heart," titled "Partout je te vois" for her album Incognito. In 1990, the English-language version of the song, titled "Have a Heart" was included on Dion's first English-language studio album, Unison. It was released as the fifth, but promotional only, single in Canada on 8 July 1991.

===Background and release===
In 1987, Dion recorded French-language version of "Just Have a Heart" (titled "Partout je te vois") with words by Eddy Marnay and included it on her album, Incognito. Dion performed the original English-language version at the Juno Awards of 1987. Her well-received performance allowed her to gain a bigger budget to create her first English-language album, Unison (1990). Dion also recorded the English-language version of the song for this album. It was produced by David Foster and titled "Have a Heart". Thanks to this song, Foster was nominated for the Juno Award for Producer of the Year in 1991. Dion released "Have a Heart" as the fifth and last single from Unison in Canada in July 1991.

===Critical reception===
Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described the song as an "epic, slow number, perfect for spending those last few minutes of the night with someone special."

In Canada, "Have a Heart" entered the RPM Top Singles chart on 13 July 1991 and peaked at number 26 on 14 September 1991. The song also entered the RPM Adult Contemporary chart on 6 July 1991 and reached number four there on 31 August 1991.
