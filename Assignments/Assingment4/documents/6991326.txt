==Reception==


Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play was given mixed reviews from game critics. On the review aggregator Game Rankings, the game has an average score of 62%, based on 35 reviews. On Metacritic, the game has an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 24 reviews.
The collection has been criticized for lacking bonus content, for its "bare-bones" presentation, lengthy load times, and for making some games look "stretched", (like Paperboy), or "shrunk", (like Sinistar), although one can press the L trigger and hit the Square button when a game is paused to enable a secret functionality  that displays the games in their original aspect ratio.
