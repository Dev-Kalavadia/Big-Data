Title: List of Rutgers University Greek organizations

Rutgers University is home to chapters of many Greek organizations; however, only a small percentage of the undergraduate student body is active in Greek life.  Several fraternities and sororities maintain houses for their chapters in the area of Union Street (known as "Frat Row") in New Brunswick within blocks of Rutgers' College Avenue Campus.

In 1845, Delta Phi became the first fraternity to organize on the campus.  Zeta Psi was the second fraternity and was organized in 1845 as well. Delta Upsilon was the third fraternity to establish itself on the campus in 1858; the first non-secret fraternity in New Brunswick. The Alpha Rho chapter of Chi Psi fraternity, founded at Rutgers College in 1879, was the first fraternity at Rutgers to own a fraternity house, or "Lodge", purchased in 1887. The fraternity today still owns and occupies the same property at 114 College Avenue. Presently, there are over fifty fraternities and sororities on the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, ranging from traditional to historically African-American, Latino, Multicultural and Asian-interest organizations.Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs at Rutgers University, Retrieved 9 September 2006. Greek organizations are governed by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs. Twelve organizations currently maintain chapters in New Brunswick without sanction by the University's administration.Registered Fraternities and Sororities  Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, Rutgers University, Retrieved 9 September 2006.
