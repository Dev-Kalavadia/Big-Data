Title: The Wonderful Galaxy of Oz




Space Oz no Bōken (Japanese: スペースオズの冒険, Hepburn: Supēsu Ozu no Bōken,  Adventures of Space Oz) is an anime TV series based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. Produced by Enoki Films and E&G Films, the series originally premiered on October 5, 1992 and ran for a total of 26 episodes. 

In 1996, Enoki Films' North American division produced a 75-minute film edited from several episodes of Space Oz no Bōken, known as The Wonderful Galaxy of Oz; it was released on DVD by Digiview Entertainment in 2006.

==Plot==
In the year 2060, eight-year-old Dorothy and her dog Talk-Talk are swept off their home planet of New Kansas in the aftermath of a catastrophic storm. They end up in the Galaxy of Oz, where an evil witch known as Gloomhilda once ruled; eventually driven out by renowned scientist Dr. Oz, she now has her sights on reclaiming the galaxy and has amassed an army in the outskirts of space. Her attack, however, is foiled due to Dorothy's unexpected arrival.

Knowing that Gloomhilda will return, Dr. Oz plans to use three magic crystals previously thought to have been lost for hundreds of years (the Crystals of Love, Wisdom, and Courage) to rid the galaxy of her wickedness. Under Dr. Oz's guidance, Dorothy and an assortment of "heroes" set out to scour the Galaxy in search of the crystals.
