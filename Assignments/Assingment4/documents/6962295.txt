She carries both passengers and freight, and calls at major towns on both the Malawian and Mozambican coast, as well as at two islands of the lake (Likoma and Chizumulu).

She is  long overall, has a gross tonnage of 620 tons and can accommodate up to 365 passengers and 100 tons of cargo.Cruise in Malawi 

==History==
 
Yarrow Shipbuilders at Scotstoun near Glasgow, Scotland built Ilala for Nyasaland Railways in 1949. As she was the second boat to be built for service on Lake Malawi (the first being built in 1875 at Poplar), and her predecessor was called Ilala, the ship was formally named Ilala II, but she is now commonly called just Ilala and this is also how the name is painted on the hull.  In turn, the first Ilala was named after the Ilala region of Zambia, where David Livingstone was first buried.

Once built, the ship was dismantled and transported to Malawi (then Nyasaland) in pieces, first by ship to Mozambique and then from Beira, Mozambique by rail and road to Chipoka.Malawi: Sixty Years of the MV Ilala BBC World Service 22 December 2008 She is operated by Malawi Lake Services and based in Monkey Bay, Malawi (on the southern end of the lake); She began operating in 1951, and has run continuously since then, except for periods of maintenance.Steamer Ilala II Launched Railway Gazette 6 April 1951 page 376 She also survived several groundings. Some steel panels have been repaired over time, and she was re-engined in the 1990s. When Ilala has been out of service for maintenance, she was usually replaced by a companion, newer ferry called  (which means "peace" in Chewa), which otherwise only cruises the southern part of the lake.Malawi transportation The  also provides additional coverage for Ilala.
