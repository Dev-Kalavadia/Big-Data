A music video, directed by Chris Hicky, was released in mid October; it features Pickler wearing black tank top, and red top, denim jeans and red high heels. In the video, Pickler is shown approaching her ex-boyfriend as he is playing football. He starts to follow her but she pushes him away. She gets in her car with her girlfriends and drives to a nightclub, where she is shown performing on stage, with her band, as live entertainment. Her ex attempts to follow her to the club, but he is stopped at the door by the bouncer.

Portions of the video were shot at Robinson Stadium, and the high school football field in Watertown, Tennessee. The band performance was filmed at the Exit/In, a Nashville club.
