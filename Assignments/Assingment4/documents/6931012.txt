Linescio is a municipality in the district of Vallemaggia in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Linescio is first mentioned in 1437 as Lignazio. In 1602 it was mentioned as Linezio.

The parish church of S. Remigio was built in 1640 and rebuilt in 1817-19. In 1757, it split away from the parish of Cevio to become its own parish.

The slopes around the village were heavily terraced, creating most of the farm land for the village. Rye, hemp, flax and later potatoes were grown on the terraces. As a result of emigration out of Switzerland in the 19th Century and emigration to the cities after 1950, most of the fields, meadows and pastures were abandoned. In 2000, no one in Linescio worked in agriculture. On the right side of the valley, there is some mining. At the beginning of the 21st Century a project was developed to save the terraces from decay.
