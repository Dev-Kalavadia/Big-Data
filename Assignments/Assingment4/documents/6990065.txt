Title: Douglas Community School





Douglas Community School, also known as Douglas Com, The Com or DCS, is an all-boys community school in Douglas, Cork, Ireland. It was founded as Col√°iste Muire by the Presentation Brothers in 1926 as a juniorate (i.e. for lower-cycle secondary students). In 1965 it became a full secondary school. In 1974, it became one of the first "community schools" in Ireland, when it was transferred by the Presentation Brothers to a local board of management. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork's representatives are trustees on the board of management.
Its uniform is a navy jumper with royal blue and yellow stripes at neckline. The school also hosts adult education evening classes.

On 16 October 2017, during Storm Ophelia, the school gym was damaged and its roof blown off.
