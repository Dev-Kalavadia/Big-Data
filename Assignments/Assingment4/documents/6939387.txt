Title: Delta-ring
In mathematics, a non-empty collection of sets \mathcal{R} is called a -ring (pronounced "") if it is closed under union, relative complementation, and countable intersection. The name "delta-ring" originates from the German word for intersection, "Durschnitt", which is meant to highlight the ring's closure under countable intersection, in contrast to a -ring which is closed under countable unions. 

== Definition ==

A family of sets \mathcal{R} is called a -ring if it has all of the following properties:

#Closed under finite unions: A \cup B \in \mathcal{R} for all A, B \in \mathcal{R},
#Closed under relative complementation: A - B \in \mathcal{R} for all A, B \in \mathcal{R}, and
#Closed under countable intersections: \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{R} if A_n \in \mathcal{R} for all n \in \N.

If only the first two properties are satisfied, then \mathcal{R} is a ring of sets but not a -ring. Every -ring is a -ring, but not every -ring is a -ring.

-rings can be used instead of σ-algebras in the development of measure theory if one does not wish to allow sets of infinite measure.

== Examples ==

The family \mathcal{K} = \{ S \subseteq \mathbb{R} : S \text{ is bounded} \} is a -ring but not a -ring because \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} [0, n] is not bounded.
