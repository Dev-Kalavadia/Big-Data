Title: Don't Let Go (Love)


"Don't Let Go (Love)" is a song by American R&B group En Vogue. It was written by Ivan Matias, Andrea Martin, and Marqueze Etheridge, and produced by Organized Noize for the Set It Off soundtrack (1996), also appearing on the group's third album, EV3 (1997). The song was the group’s last single and music video to feature member Dawn Robinson and was En Vogue's biggest international single, making it to the top 10 in several countries. According to Billboard, the single ranked as the 83rd most successful single of the 1990s.

==Background==
"Don't Let Go (Love)" was written by Andrea Martin, Ivan Matias, Marqueze Ethridge, and Organized Noize members Sleepy Brown, Rico Wade, and Ray Murray, while production was by Organized Noize. Vocal production was supervised by Matias. Dawn Robinson sings the entire lead while Maxine Jones performs the bridge. Cindy Herron performs a verse to the bridge. Terry Ellis sings outro lyrics in the music video version and "Fulton Yard Mix". Martin Terry and Tommy Martin played the guitars on the song, while drums were played by Lil' John. Marvin "Chanz" Parkman played the grand piano.

The song compelled Elektra mogul Sylvia Rhone to place En Vogue back in the studio to record their EV3 project for release in 1997. While the other group members plus the record producers and label executives were focused on the new En Vogue album, Dawn Robinson wanted to pursue a solo career. Forced to choose between the group or her solo project, Robinson decided to leave En Vogue for a recording deal with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records. The turn of events following the success of the song was the beginning of a long and tumultuous era for En Vogue as member changes became quite frequent.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as "yearning". Larry Flick from Billboard called it a "bluesy interlude", and commented further that the harmonies are "instantly recognizable, flexing sweetly over the track's live funk beat and snaky guitar licks. If you're looking for a duplication of past hits, forget it. This is a far more musically mature effort that will appeal to both street and sophisticated tastes." J.D. Considine from Entertainment Weekly wrote in his review of EV3, "No surprise, then, that although the women get top billing, the arrangements are the real stars. "Don’t Let Go (Love)" is the most obvious example, since the interplay between lead and background vocals is as disciplined as it is dramatic." Another editor, David Grad noted its "combination of sensual harmonies and sultry attitude", and deemed it as a "provocative little offering". Dave Ferman from Fort Worth Star-Telegram said the song is "hauntingly lush", and that it "finds the singers' voices ebbing and flowing like the ocean on a threatening day." A reviewer from Music Week rated it four out of five, stating that "the girls let rip with a swoonsome, powerful single" and a "positive taster" for a spring album, that "should please fans and ensure they attract a few more." 

Gerald Martinez from New Straits Times called it "dramatic", noting that "this song has all the punch, power and stunning voices in harmony that one has come to expect from En Vogue." Rebecca Schiller from NME said the group's performance "was gutsy and full of knowing gravitas." Another editor, John Mulvey stated that the single "retains a frankly terrifying power". A reviewer for People Magazine wrote that it is "still smoldering", noting the song's "tough sound", and picking it as the highlight of EV3."Picks and Pans Review". People. Elysa Gardner from Rolling Stone described it as a "even more aggressive tune", and added that the "slow-burning" track "promote romantic and carnal abandon, advising lovers to proceed without caution." Laura Jamison from Salon Magazine noted it as a "tempestuous" and "sexy" single. Ann Powers from Spin called it a "cry for a lover's loyalty that En Vogue convert into a nonnegotiable demand". She complimented the song as their "highest achievement" on EV3. Ian Hyland from Sunday Mirror commented, "The hit singles Whatever and Don't Let Go may well be brilliant but they only add more spice to a mighty fine collection."Hyland, Ian (June 15, 1997).
