Title: Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology





The Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology (IMarEST) is the international membership body and learned society for marine professionals operating in the spheres of marine engineering, science, or technology. It has registered charity status in the UK. It has a worldwide membership of 21,000 individuals based in over 128 countries. The institute is a member of the UK Science Council and a licensed body of the Engineering Council UK.

== Overview ==
The Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology was the international membership body and learned society for professionals operating in the spheres of marine engineering, science, or technology.

The institute envisions "a world where marine resources and activities are sustained, managed and developed for the benefit of humanity."Our profile at imarest.org. Retrieved 06.2015.

The mission of the institute is described as "to work within the global marine community to promote the scientific development of marine engineering, science and technology, providing opportunities for the exchange of ideas and practices and upholding the status, standards and knowledge of marine professionals worldwide."

IMarEST is also a publisher of books, periodicals, journals and papers related to marine engineering, science and technology, and organises meetings, events and conferences related to these themes. The institute is also the home of the Guild of Benevolence of the IMarEST, which continues the work of the fund founded for the families of the engineers of the Titanic, and which today provides help and funds for those seafarers and others who find themselves in hard times.

==History==

The Institute of Marine Engineers had its headquarters at 88 Minories in the City of London. It changed its name to the IMarEST in 1999. It has since moved to a location in Westminster.

=== Corporate Membership Categories ===
IMarEST have defined three types of membership categories:

* Fellow : Fellows are those who qualify for the category of Member and have demonstrated to the satisfaction of Council a level of knowledge and understanding, competence and commitment involving superior responsibility for the conceptual design, management or the execution of important work in a marine related profession, and have given a commitment to abide by the Institute's Code of Professional Conduct.
* Member : Members are those who qualify for the category of Associate Member and have demonstrated to the satisfaction of Council that they have achieved a position of professional standing having normally been professionally engaged in the marine sector for a period of five years that includes significant responsibility and have given a commitment to abide by the Institute's Code of Professional Conduct
* Associate Member : Associate Members those demonstrating to the satisfaction of Council that they have achieved a position as a technician, or are professionally engaged in Initial Professional Development or occupy an occupational role in the marine sector, and have given a commitment to abide by the Institute's Code of Professional Conduct

And two types of non-corporate membership categories: 
* Affiliate : Affiliates may either be those with an interest in, or who may contribute to, the activities of the Institute or; persons who, in the opinion of Council, can contribute to, or wish to have access to, the technical services of the institute, being resident in a recognised overseas territory and also members of a professional society with which the institute has a reciprocal arrangement.
* Student : Student members are those enrolled on a programme of further or higher education accredited or recognised by the IMarEST.

=== Registration ===
In addition to Membership, the IMarEST is licensed to provide a range of professional registers covering the fields of engineering, science and technology. In addition, the IMarEST's Royal Charter empowers the institute to offer registers designed to meet the specific needs of the marine profession. Corporate members can become registered (chartered) as:

=== Magazines ===
The IMarEST used to publish multiple professional magazines for the science, engineering and technology community, but in October 2014 amalgamated content from its five established and sector specific magazines (MER, Shipping World and Shipbuilder, Maritime IT & Electronics, Offshore Technology and Marine Scientist) in to a single, generic publication. Marine Professional, published by Think Publishing. describes itself as "looking at the trends emerging within the marine sector with a view to enhance the reader's understanding of the complex technical intersections between the maritime, offshore and science agendas." It refers to itself as "the voice of marine…" It is published on a monthly basis and is distributed in print and online.

=== Technical and Scientific Journals ===
In addition to the professional magazines outlined above, the IMarEST also publishes a number of subscription only, academic, peer-reviewed journals which present international research papers describing the latest discoveries, developments and advances in the marine sector.

Both the Journal of Marine Engineering & Technology and the Journal of Operational Oceanography are peer-reviewed and are included in the Science Citation Index Expanded.

* The Journal of Marine Engineering & Technology (JMET)Published three times a year in print and online, The Journal of Marine Engineering and Technology contains papers of a specialist academic nature covering research, theory and scientific studies concerned with all aspects of marine engineering and technology.
Editors: Dr A Greig and Dr R Bucknall, UCL, LONDON UK

* Journal of Operational Oceanography (JOO)Published twice a year in print and online, The Journal of Operational Oceanography disseminates and reports on scientific and applied research advances associated with all aspects of operational oceanography. The journal incorporates papers that examine the role of oceanography in contributing to all marine disciplines, address the needs of one or more of a wide range of end user communities and address the requirements of global observing systems.
Editor: Prof Ralph Rayner, CMarSci, FIMarEST, London School of Economics (LSE)

* Marine Technical Notes (MTN)Published online only, the IMarEST E-Journal, 'Marine Technical Notes' aims to cater for papers covering research of a more practical nature in marine engineering, science and technology.  Issues will include student papers, review papers, lecture papers, letters and technical notes.

Papers published in the JMET and the JOO are eligible for the IMarEST Denny Medal, a special annual prize awarded to the authors of the best paper in each Journal.

Lectures are given by members of the maritime community taking Lord Kelvin's foresight and applying it to the development of future technologies

;Branch Events
In addition, branches also have their own technical and social events which are advertised through the IMarEST website and publications.
