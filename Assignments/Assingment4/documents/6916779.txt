Little is known about its history.  It is named after Spanish naval commander Juan de Lángara.  During Lángara's period at the head of the Spanish navy, Spanish explorers were charting the coast of what is now British Columbia, and, in their charts, named some land formations after him. Juan José Pérez Hernández was the first European to sight, examine, name, and record these islands.  His frigate was the Santiago, which was crewed mostly by Mexicans. In July 1774, he briefly met a group of Haida off the northwestern tip of Langara Island. In 1913 the Langara Light was lit at the northwest corner of the island. It is one of the largest islands from which Norway rats have been eradicated. The eradication campaign for R. norvegicus was begun in July 1995 using anti-coagulant bait and the island was declared free of rats in May 1997.Kaiser et al. 1997

On 6 September 2018, the Haida Legend sank off Langara Island. The vessel had been fishing halibut and the cause of the sinking is unknown. All members of the crew were rescued.
