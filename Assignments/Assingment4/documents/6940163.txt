==Marvin Gordon (Oakwood)==

Gordon (born in Toronto March 18, 1930, died January 26, 2013) was a frequent candidate for public office during the 1970s.  A 1972 newspaper report lists him as a thirty-four-year-old teacher and lawyer.Wendy Darroch, "'Highest taxes in Metro', but York voters say they're content", Toronto Star, 17 November 1972, p. 4.  In the 1974 municipal election, he campaigned for school trustee on the slogans "Cut the high cost of education and reduce your taxes" and "Restore traditional values to the classroom"."Ward 5 - Borough of York" [advertisement], 30 November 1974, A17.  He later campaigned in favour of lower property taxes and an increased police presence."Borough of York", Toronto Star, 10 November 1978, A20; Lynne Ainsworth, "28 vie for 8 aldermanic seat", Toronto Star, 3 November 1982, C16.

He was president of York's Ward One Tenants Association in 1975, and opposed plans to have trucks routed through the area by authorities in Metropolitan Toronto."Blockade threat if trucks continue using York Road", Toronto Star, 19 February 1975, B02.

Gordon was a member of the Liberal Party during the 1970s, and contested the party's nomination for Oakwood in 1975.  After losing to Richard Meagher, he ran as an independent candidate.Kent Potter, "3 parties claim they lead in Oakwood", Toronto Star, 10 September 1975, A11.  He later affiliated with the New Democratic Party, and campaigned with the endorsement of that party and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation in the 1985 municipal election.  He opposed the extension of separate school funding, and wanted an increased emphasis on basic learning.Kim Zarzour, "50 run for North York school board", Toronto Star, 29 October 1985, E7.

He received 558 votes (2.96%) in the 1975 election, finishing fourth against New Democratic Party candidate Tony Grande.
