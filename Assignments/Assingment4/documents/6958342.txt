Title: Cimadera

Cimadera is a former municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in  Switzerland.  On 14 April 2013 the former municipalities of Bogno, Cadro, Carona, Certara, Cimadera, Valcolla and Sonvico merged into the municipality of Lugano.

==History==
Cimadera is first mentioned in 1422 as cima d'Era.  The village was originally an alpine herding camp for the inhabitants of the village Treciore which was part of the town of Sonvico.  After the plague of 1525, they settled there permanently.  In the 16th century it belonged to the Kastlanei and parish of Sonvico.  In 1878 the municipality was created when it separated from Sonvico to become an independent municipality and parish.

The chapel of St. Anthony of Padua dates from the 17th century.  The prayer house of S. Maria ed Elisabetta or della Visitazione was built in 1670.

The decline of agriculture and the urbanization of the villages surrounding Lugano, since the beginning of the 20th century, have depopulated the town.  Many houses have been converted into second or vacation homes.
