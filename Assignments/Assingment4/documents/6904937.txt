Title: 67th World Science Fiction Convention



The 67th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), also known as Anticipation, was held on 6–10 August 2009 at the Palais des congrès de Montréal in Montréal, Québec, Canada.

The organising committee was co-chaired by René Walling and Robbie Bourget.

This convention was also the 2009 Canvention, and therefore presented the Prix Aurora Awards.

This was the fifth Worldcon to be held in Canada, and the first one to be held in an officially French-speaking city.
