This mushroom is rich in glycoprotein (HM-3A), marmorin, beta-(1-3)-glucan, hypsiziprenol, and hypsin therefore is a potential natural anticancer agent. Shimeji mushrooms contain angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which is an oligopeptide that may be helpful in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of stroke in persons having hypertension. Also rich in polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. Therefore, inhibits inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress and protects from lung failure.

The cooked mushroom has a pleasant, firm, slightly crunchy texture and a slightly nutty flavor.  Cooking also makes this mushroom easier to digest. It works well in stir-fried foods like stir-fried vegetables, as well as with wild game or seafood.https://foodthesis.com/shimeji-mushroom-health-benefits-and-side-effects/ Also, it can be used in soups, stews, and in sauces.

Shimeji is used in soups, nabe and takikomi gohan.
