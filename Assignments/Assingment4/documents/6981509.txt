Title: Savosa

Savosa is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Savosa is first mentioned in 1335 as Savoxa.

In the Middle Ages Savosa and Rovello were two separate Vicinanza, which were under the Pieve of Lugano. The cathedral of San Lorenzo in Lugano possessed extensive lands in Rovello in the 11th and 12th centuries.  In the 14th century the Bishop of Como had feudal rights in both Savosa and Rovello.

The S. Maurizio complex in Rovello, which is now part of Lugano, consisted of a farmhouse, a chapel (mentioned in 1203) and a cemetery.  It was founded by the Humiliati order.  In 1365 it was taken over by the Bishop of Como and the Hospital of S. Maria in Lugano.  The sugar magnate Emilio Maraini purchased the complex in 1906.

Savosa was part of the parish of Lugano until 1801 when it went to the Porza parish.  It became an independent parish in 1825 and was joined by Rovello and Crocifisso in 1927.  The parish church of Beata Vergine Annunciata was first mentioned in 1578, was rebuilt several times in the 18th and 19th centuries and restored in 1993.

The local economy was based on agriculture, with some trade and industry, especially in the 20th century.  In 1903 a nursery opened, followed in 1907 by a vineyard.  In the second half of the 20th century, several companies in the real estate and construction sector settled in the hamlet of Crocifisso.  The hamlets 1957 link to the city's tramway network and location near Lugano made it an attractive site.  This development led to growth throughout the municipality.  The high school Gymnasium Lugano 2 was built in Savosa.  In 2000, four-fifths of the working population are commuters, especially to Lugano.
