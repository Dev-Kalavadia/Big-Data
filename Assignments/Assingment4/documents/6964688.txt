Title: The Troubles in Moneymore

A total of seven people were killed in Troubles-related violence in or near the County Londonderry village of Moneymore, of whom six were Protestant and one Catholic. All were killed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) except 71-year-old Protestant Samuel Miller, who was beaten to death by the Ulster Defence Association after witnessing a robbery. 

Of the IRA's six victims, three were members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and one was a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment. The IRA's two civilian victims were a Catholic farmer inadvertently killed by a booby trap bomb on his farm, and a contractor, Harry Henry, for the British Army and RUC who was shot at his home in The Loup. Henry was a Protestant businessman who had set up a building company with his brother which prospered by supplying bomb-proof windows and repairing damaged security bases around Northern Ireland.Toolis, Kevin (1995).

All were killed in separate incidents except for two of the RUC officers, who were shot by IRA gunmen after a car chase. McKittrick, D., Kelters, S., Feeney, B. and Thornton, C. Lost Lives.
