Title: Lego Studios



Lego Studios was a popular brand of Lego toys released in 2000 and mainly focused on movie-making and the steps thereof. Lego Studios was first distributed in November 2000, and was later discontinued in 2003. The last series in the franchise was the Lego Spider-Man set. The appeal of Lego Studios was that it could be used for stop-motion animation to make films with Lego bricks. In response, many websites have grown that are dedicated to the product and feature many uploaded videos, such as Brickfilms.com.

The Lego Director character appears in several Lego Studio sets and video games. He is a Lego minifigure of Steven Spielberg. The Lego Director is always seen with a brown beard, small glasses, and a black baseball cap. He also wears a white shirt with an orange waistcoat worn over it. His shirt says "DIRECTOR" on the back. He also has an ID card on his waistcoat and wears black pants.

In 2000 Lego had held The Lego Studios Movie Making Contest. It was a brickfilming competition hosted by The Lego  Group to tie in with the launch of Lego Studios. It began in late 2000, making it the earliest known brickfilming competition. It also tied in with a brickfilm category in a German film festival, and there was also a very little-known United Kingdom edition of the contest.
