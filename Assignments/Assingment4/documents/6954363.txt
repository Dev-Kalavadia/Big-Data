Title: No. 63 Squadron RAF





Number 63 Squadron was a bomber aircraft and training squadron of the Royal Air Force that was active during various periods from 1916 to 1992. Originally using De Havilland DH4 aircraft in World War I, it was last equipped with BAe Hawk jet trainers.

==History==
===First World War===
No. 63 Squadron was formed on 31 August 1916 at Stirling, Scotland as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. The squadron was intended to operate as a day-bomber unit over the Western Front in France, and was therefore equipped with de Havilland DH4 aircraft; however at the last minute the squadron was re-tasked to operate against the Turkish army in Mesopotamia (Iraq) and was re-equipped with R.E.8's for its new mission, when the squadron arrived in the Middle East in August 1917. No. 63 Squadron remained in Mesopotamia for the rest of the war, and it was disbanded on 29 February 1920.

===Inter-war===
In February 1937, now as a Royal Air Force unit, the squadron was refounded at Andover, Hampshire as a bomber unit, and three months later became the first unit to receive the Fairey Battle aircraft. Early in 1939 the unit was assigned an aircrew training role, and received a number of Avro Ansons, but the unit lost its separate identity in April 1940 when it became a part of No. 12 OTU.

===Second World War===
On 15 June 1942 No. 63 Squadron was reformed from part of No. 239 Squadron at RAF Gatwick, West Sussex with Alison engined North American Mustang I's. In January 1944 the squadron moved to RAF Turnhouse in Scotland and was re-equipped with Hawker Hurricane IV's in April 1944, converting to Supermarine Spitfire VB's in early May 1944. By the end of May the squadron was based at RNAS Lee-on-Solent, preparing for D-Day. During the allied landings 63 Squadron flew spotter flights above the Royal Navy, providing a form of Forward Air Control (FAC) for the naval gunners supporting the troops on land. The pilots of the squadron at this stage were drawn from former Army co-operation units, The Royal Marines and  as well as the RAF. On 20 September 1944 the squadron relocated to RAF North Weald. The squadron was disbanded on 1 February 1945.
