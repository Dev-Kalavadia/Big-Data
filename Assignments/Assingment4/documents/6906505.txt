== History ==
South Puget Sound Community College was established in 1962 as Olympia Vocational Technical Institute (OVTI) located at the old Montgomery Ward Building in downtown Olympia. The Olympia school board had been working since 1957 to widen education opportunity in the Olympia area for adults, originally via classes offered at Olympia High School. By 1966, technical training expanded to 14 fields in respect to Olympia citizens' requests. The Community College Act of 1967 gave the Olympia Vocational Institute the option to either remain with Olympia School District or to merge into the community college system. The school decided to join the community college system, merging into district 12 under the control of Centralia Community College, becoming Olympia Technical Community College (OTCC) in 1976.

By 1982, a few hundred students were first awarded Associate of Arts Degree and more programs were added at the school. In 1984, college was renamed South Puget Sound Community College to reflect its progressive record.
