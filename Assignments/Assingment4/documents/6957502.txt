==History==
Arosio is first mentioned in 1335 as Aroxio.  Breno is first mentioned in 1140 as Breno.  Fescoggia is first mentioned in 1296 as Fescozia.  Mugena is first mentioned in 1214 as Megiadina.  In 1270 it was mentioned as Migena.  Vezio is first mentioned in 1355 as Vecio.

===Arosio===
According to tradition, the Roman road leading from Ponte Tresa to Monte Ceneri Pass ran through Arosio.  By the Middle Ages it was a central town in the upper Magliasina valley, which was at that time was known as the Valle d'Arosio.  The villages of Arosio, Breno, Cademario, Mugena Tortoglio and Vezio formed an economic and political unit.

The Church of San Michele is first mentioned in 1217.  In 1640-47 it was totally rebuilt.  It contains a cycle of frescoes by Antonio da Tradate and notable stucco work by local artists from the 17th and 18th centuries.  At one time, the architects and master builders of Arosio operated throughout Europe.

The local economy was based on agriculture and herding in the alpine meadows.  In recent decades the services sector dominated the local economy.  After 1960, a number of new houses were built in the village.

===Breno===
Archaeological digs have uncovered items from the Roman era in Breno.  The village name is Celtic in origin, though the exact meaning is unknown.  At some time after the year 1000, the Abbey of S. Abbondio in Como acquired some rights and land in Breno.  The municipality bought itself out from under those rights in 1579.  Modernly, the village includes the south land that once belonged to the municipality of Tortoglio.  This land was abandoned in the wake of a plague in the 15th century.  The village was involved in a land dispute with Miglieglia until 1890.

The parish was established as Fescoggia parish in 1592.  The Parish Church of S. Lorenzo was built in 1233, rebuilt in 1596 and expanded in 1852.

The local economy included both agriculture and herding in alpine pastures.  Alp Rettaiola (alpine pasture) was lost after a century-long dispute with the Italian Valle Veddasca, following a by a decision of the Varese Congress in 1752.  In the upper Malcantone Valley many of the farmers own land both in the Valley and in the lower, hilly area between Neggio and Bosco Luganese.  Before winter sets in, they move their animals down into the hills to their winter pastures.  The seasonal migration began in the 16th century and was very common until the beginning of the 19th century.  Between 16th and 19th centuries, limited land and resources led to a large exodus of construction workers from Breno.  A strong philanthropic attitude and community life, often supported by grants from wealthy villagers who had emigrated, allowed the village to build a number of institutions in the 19th century.  The most important is the school of drawing from 1883.  By the end of the 20th century, many of the workers in Breno commuted to Lugano for work.

===Fescoggia===
According to a 1296 document Fescoggia was one of only two villages that was in the Lugano area, but was totally owned by Como Cathedral.  The Monastery of S. Abbondio in Como owned the tithe right in the village, but sold it in 1579 to Breno.

Fescoggia belongs to the parish of Breno.  The Chapel of S. Silvester was built in the late 13th century, over the ruins of a church dedicated to Madonna of the snows.  It was renovated in the late 18th century.

In the 15th century, the village area also included Monti di Lot and Alp Firinesc.  Until the end of the 19th century, the inhabitants also drove their animals in a seasonal migration to alpine pastures to the east slopes of the mountains of Santa Maria and Cervello.  On Monte Torri, in the 19th century, an iron ore (hematite) mine opened a furnace for smelting operation was built.  In 2000, more than four-fifths of the workers living in Fescoggia were commuters.

===Mugena===

A random discovery led to the excavation of a Roman cremation cemetery.  In the Middle Ages, Como Cathedral possessed property, tithes and rights to use alpine meadows over half of Nisciora Alp.  Some documents mention a castrum, probably a supply camp, but his determination remains controversial.  In the 13th century, Mugena belonged to the Valle d'Arosio (upper Magliasina Valley), an economic and administrative unit, which included Arosio, Breno, Cademario, Mugena, Tortoglio and Vezio.

The parish church of S. Agata is first mentioned in 1361. In 1636 it was, after Mugena separated from Breno, promoted to a vice parish.  The church was renovated and toward the end of the 17th century, completely rebuilt.  The current church features valuable stucco work from the 18th century.

The village has retained its rural appearance.  Historically, farming and grazing in the alpine meadows of S. Maria and Cervello were the main source of income.  At the beginning of the 21st century, most residents in the valley work in Lugano.

===Vezio===
In the Early Middle Ages, the Bishop and monastery of St. Abbondio in Como owned property and rights in Vezio.  It was part of the parish of Breno until 1626, when it became part of the Mugena parish.  It was established in 1684 as a vice-parish.

The parish church of St. Bartholomew was built in 1745 on the grounds at a former building, which dates from 1444.  Inside the church there are fine stucco by artists from the Malcantone Valley.

Until the Second World War there was a strong migration of construction workers to jobs outside Switzerland.  Until the late 19th century, part of the population seasonally migrated to the eastern slopes of the mountains of S. Maria and Cervello.  In the early 20th century a small hydroelectric plant was built near the village.
