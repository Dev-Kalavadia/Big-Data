==Maumee Performing Arts Center at Maumee High School==
Thanks to donations from local businesses (Ed Schmidt Auto Group, Maison-Dardenne-Walker Funeral Home, the Andersons, the Buehrer Group, Fifth Third Bank, St. Luke's Hospital, and the Maumee Rotary Foundation), a long-awaited theater was completed on the school campus. Prior to its construction, Maumee High was one of few in the region without a theater. Instead, productions commenced at other venues or Gateway Middle School, one mile away. They have recently performed such plays as Take Her, She's Mine, My Fair Lady, The Servant of Two Masters, Guys and Dolls, Alice in Wonderland, and The Wizard of Oz.

The Maumee Performing Arts Center at Maumee High School also served as temporary host to the Toledo Opera, Toledo Ballet, and others from late November 2007 through March 2008, after a fire closed the Valentine Theater.
