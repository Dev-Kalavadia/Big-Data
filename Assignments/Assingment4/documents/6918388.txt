Title: Lince (armored car)

The Autoblindo Lince ("Lynx") was an Italian scout car used by the Italian Social Republic between 1943-1945 during World War II. The Lince was a copy of the British Daimler Dingo and was primarily used for reconnaissance. Its armament consisted of a single 8 mm machine gun. Some 250 vehicles were built in all.

In 1943 only a single vehicle was completed but the German forces tested this prototype and ordered 300, of which 129 examples were delivered in 1944-45 and designated Panzerspähwagen Lince 202(i).

These cars were employed in Italy and the Balkans for reconnaissance, escort and internal security, some being assigned to support Organisation Todt.
