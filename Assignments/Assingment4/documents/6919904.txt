Title: Roman Catholic Diocese of Auxerre

The diocese of Auxerre () is a former French Roman Catholic diocese. Its historical episcopal see was in the city of Auxerre in Burgundy, now part of eastern France. Currently the non-metropolitan Archbishop of Sens, ordinary of the diocese of Sens and Auxerre, resides in Auxerre.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The Gesta pontificum Autissiodorensium, written about 875 by the canons Rainogala and Alagus, and later continued up to 1278, gives a list of bishops of Auxerre.  Louis Duchesne regards the list as mostly accurate, but very arbitrary in its dates prior to the 7th century. Auxerre is remarkable among French churches for the number of its bishops who have come to be regarded as saints.Gesta Pontificum Autissiodorensium, sussex.ac.ukGesta episcoporum Autissiodorensium - Gesta pontificum Autissiodorensium, mirabileweb.it 1385.
