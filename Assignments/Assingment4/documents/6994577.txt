Title: Everyday (Dave Matthews Band song)


"Everyday" is the closing track and third radio single from Dave Matthews Band's album Everyday. It reached #38 on Modern Rock Tracks, and #8 on Adult Top 40. A live version of "Everyday" is featured on the Dave Matthews Band compilation album The Best of What's Around Vol. 1. The song evolved from an earlier DMB song entitled "#36" and references The Beatles' song All You Need Is Love.

When the song is played live, the song "#36" is mixed in with the song "Everyday." It is also a tradition for the crowd to sing, "Hani, Hani, come and dance with me" during the parts of the song that #36 mixes in with.  This can be heard on such CDs as The Best of What's Around Vol. 1, Live Trax Vol. 6, The Gorge, Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado, and on Weekend on the Rocks.

An acoustic version of the song was played live on February 28, 2001 by Dave Matthews and Trey Anastasio during the latter's solo performance at the Landmark Theatre in Richmond, Virginia.

On September 21, 2001, Dave Matthews played an acoustic version of the song as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes concert, performed in remembrance of the victims of the September 11 attacks.

The song was not originally supposed to be the third single from the album. "When the World Ends" was originally supposed to be the single, but after 9/11 it was thought that the dark title would not be appropriate.

The song has enjoyed consistent popularity as a live staple and has been played live every year since its release (2001–2018). As of 2018, it has been the most played live song from the Everyday album.
