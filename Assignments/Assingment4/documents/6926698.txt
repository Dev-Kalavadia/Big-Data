He then scored his second goal, in a 1–0 win over Standard Liège on 17 September 2010 and third goal came on 1 October 2010, in a 2–2 draw against Genk. In his first full season at the club, Pandža scored four goals in thirty-seven appearances in all competitions.

In his second season at the club, Pandža scored two goals in thirty-one appearances in all competitions. His last season with the club saw him stay at the club after his scheduled move to Arsenal Kyiv collapsed following a failure to meet Pandža's requirements. However, it went appalling for Pandža when he sustained a knee injury, in a 2–0 loss against Beerschot on 1 September 2012 and was out for four weeks. However, it was announced furthermore that he was to be out for 6 months with an injury that could miss the rest of the season. His knee surgery was a success.

In July 2013, Pandža was linked with a move to Scottish League One side Rangers. He then began talks with the club over possibly joining Rangers. He himself pleaded to Rangers, quoting: "come and get him" and even willing to risk his wages. Despite the expected agreement which lasted for two months, the move appeared to be stalled. The move was stalled, which was believed to put on hold by the club's chief executive Craig Mather and Pandža would later accuse the club of lacking professionalism for shattering his move to Rangers.

Despite a shattered move to Rangers, he joined Polish side Górnik Zabrze on a one-year contract with an option to extend it. However, after making only thirteen appearances in all competitions, Pandža was released by the club after one season.

He then returned to Široki Brijeg for the 2014–15 season, making 17 appearances as the club finished in 4th place. The following season, Pandža managed just 9 league appearances. After Široki Brijeg, he also played at Čelik Zenica and Croatian club Šibenik.
