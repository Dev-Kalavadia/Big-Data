==History==
Malvaglia is first mentioned in 1205 as de Malvallia.  In German it used to be known as Manglia. Malvaglia's development and history is closely tied to the development and history of the Blenio valley.  In the settlement of Rongier, an ancient town on the Lukmanier road, a Roman coin hoard was found.  The settlement is also home to the Casa Baggio.  Casa Baggio was built in the 16th century and expanded in the 17th.  It was probably the ruling seat of the bailiff.  The building is now listed as a historic building.  Above the village is also the remains of Casa dei pagani, a cave castle from the 11th-13th Centuries.

The original, parish church was dedicated to St. Benedict and first mentioned in 1207.  The current building, with St. Martin as the patron saint is from 1602 to 1603, but the bell tower is from the 13th Century.

The local economy was dominated by agriculture, animal husbandry, vineyards.  The emigration in until the 19th century to Italy and in the 19th and 20th centuries to France, England, and America, led to a sharp population decline.  Between 1933 and 1959, the first cable car in the Canton was in operation between Malvaglia and Ponterio in the Malvaglia Valley.  In 1995 a new line was inaugurated on Mount Dagro.  In the 1940s for the construction of the dam, a road was built into the Malvaglia Valley.  The ring road around the village open in 1976.  In 2000 about one-third and one-half of the workers were employed in manufacturing and the services sectors, respectively.  More than half of employed persons worked outside of the municipality.
