Title: Ulmus 'Morton'
 


Ulmus 'Morton' (selling name ) is an elm cultivar cloned from a putative intraspecific hybrid planted at the Morton Arboretum in 1924, which itself originated as seed collected from a tree at the Arnold Arboretum in Massachusetts. Although this tree was originally identified as Ulmus crassifolia, it is now believed to have been a hybrid of the Japanese elm (Ulmus davidiana var. japonica) and Wilson's elm (formerly Ulmus wilsoniana, but also sunk as U. davidiana var. japonica).  has proven to be the most successful cultivar tested in the US National Elm Trial, averaging a survival rate of 92.5% overall.

==Description==
The parent tree at the Morton Arboretum is noted for the resemblance of its habit to the American elm Ulmus americana, its upright-arching branches creating the familiar vase-shape, although the tree does not grow as large as the iconic native elm, reaching scarcely 20 m at maturity. Its glossy, deep green leaves are also markedly smaller, rarely exceeding 8 cm in length. The tree is commercially propagated by grafting onto an Ulmus pumila rootstock.

 has a propensity to produce co-dominant stems and major branches with bark inclusions, demanding corrective pruning on at least an annual basis where planted in towns.Iles, J. (2009). Forget your fear of the elms. Western University website

==Pests and diseases==
In its 90+ years, the original tree at Morton has survived three epidemics of Dutch elm disease there unscathed.Ware, G. Morton Arb. Quarterly, 28(1): 1–5, 1992. However, two trees included in trials at the University of Minnesota were found to be afflicted by the disease in 2004, although one appears to have recovered completely.Giblin, C. P. & Gillman, J. H. (2006). Elms for the Twin Cities: A Guide for Selection and Maintenance. University of Minnesota. The cultivar has also proved to be highly resistant to elm yellows and the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola  McPherson, G. et al. (2008). National elm trial: Initial report from Northern California. Western Arborist, Fall 2009, 32–36. , but not to the Japanese beetle, which can cause extensive foliar damage.Brady, C., Condra, J., & Potter, D.

==Cultivation==
 is reputed to grow well in almost all soils save those excessively wet, and is notably drought-tolerant and cold hardy. In artificial freezing tests at the Morton ArboretumShirazi, A. M. & Ware, G. H. (2004). Evaluation of New Elms from China for Cold Hardiness in Northern Latitudes. International Symposium on Asian Plant Diversity & Systematics 2004, Sakura, Japan. the LT50 (temp. at which 50% of tissues die) was found to be −35.5 °C. The tree grows vigorously at first, gaining as much as one metre per annum, but slows to approximately half that rate with maturity. Thus, a typical 20-year-old tree could be expected to have reached 14 m in height with a crown about 5 m in width.Guries, R. P. & Smalley, E. B., (1986), Proc. Third Nat. Urban Forestry Conf., 214–218, 1986, Orlando, Florida. Trees grown by Tollgate Education, Michigan State University, at Novi were the most vigorous and robust of the 37 different cultivars and species under assessment, described as looking like 'men among boys'.  is being evaluated in the National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University.
