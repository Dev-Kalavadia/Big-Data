Title: Skating Club of Boston
The Skating Club of Boston is a not-for-profit figure skating club based in Norwood, Massachusetts.  Founded in 1912, it is one of the oldest skating clubs in the United States, and a founding member of U.S. Figure Skating, the governing body for the sport in the United States. The Club's mission is to advance participation, education and excellence in skating for people of all ages, abilities and means. The Club has over 800 active members and offers a variety of programs for the public, reaching another 2,000 children and adults.
