Title: American University 12/13/70
American University 12/13/70 is a live album by the Allman Brothers Band.  The first of a series of archival concert recordings from the Allman Brothers Band Recording Company, it features the group's original lineup.  It was released in April 2002.

On December 13, 1970, the band played two concerts at American University in Washington, D.C.  The first five songs on the album are from the late show, and the last two songs are from the early show.

== Critical reception ==

On AllMusic, William Ruhlmann said, "There is little new here, but the playing is fierce, especially the interaction of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts, and with a solid 20-plus-minute version of "Whipping Post", Allman Brothers Band fans should be pleased with the band's first self-released effort."

Alan Paul wrote in Guitar World, "... the sudden appearance of a virtually unheard Duane-era ABB performance is big news, making it an excellent choice to debut the band's series of sanctioned, self-released archive CDs. It doesn't hurt, of course, that the band's December 13, 1970 performance was top notch."
