Title: Miglieglia

Miglieglia (; ) is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Numerous, but inconclusive archaeological findings indicate that there may have been a Roman era settlement near the current municipality.  On a promontory overlooking the river Magliasina are the ruins known as Castello di Miglieglia.  These ruins were interpreted as remnants of an extensive fortification from the late Classical period.  Although is in not confirmed archaeologically, it is likely that the ruins are the remains of a fortified refuge, which was destroyed by the Milanese in 1156 during the conquest of the Diocese of Como.

Miglieglia is first mentioned in 1214 as Mullielia.  In the Late Middle Ages, Miglieglia, Iseo, Cimo and Aranno formed the Concilium (neighborhood) of S. Maria Giovena.  In 1478 the village was destroyed in a fire.

On a hill above the village rises the romanesque-style church of S. Stefano.  Probably the oldest part of the church is the bell tower.  During the Gothic period, the church was extended.  The chancel frescoes are from 1511.  The parish was formed in 1621 after the secession of Agno.  The new, parish church of St. Stefan is from the 17th century.

Agriculture and livestock formerly dominated the village economy.  In the 19th century it was partly depopulated because of emigration to German-speaking Switzerland, northern Italy and America.  In the second half of the 19th century a mine operated for a short time.  A chair lift opened in 1952 to Monte Lema () and expanded in 1997 with a cable car.
