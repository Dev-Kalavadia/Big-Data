Prior to the building of Central Bucks High School South, portions of Tamanend Middle School was also a feeder school. CB East has a student population of 1,528, making it the second largest high school in the Central Bucks School District. The school's students follow a block scheduling system in which students take 83-minute classes for one semester, or half of each school year.

The curriculum includes eighteen Advanced Placement courses and honors courses in most disciplines. U.S.News magazine designated Central Bucks High School East as one of the best high schools in the nation. The school has consistently held a 99% graduation rate, with 90% of graduates choosing to further their education. Central Bucks East is also a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence.

CB East has undergone several additions and renovations since it was opened in 1969. Just a few years after opening, the school faced overcrowding and a two-story addition was constructed that featured "open space" concept classrooms. In 1997 a new wing of classrooms, a new auxiliary gym, and a new, larger library were added. In 2010 the school, now over 40 years old, began a multimillion-dollar addition and renovation project that would encompass the entire school and take several years to complete. The project included the addition of a new science and technology wing with 14 science labs, several computer labs, and a large filming studio. The main lobby was expanded into a two-story atrium, and almost every space in the building received new flooring, modern, efficient lighting with occupancy sensors, and new Smart Board projection systems. The project was completed in 2013. In 2015, the school's Athletic Facility was reconstructed, consisting of a new football Stadium and bleachers for the East Patriots Team, as well as a new track field and tennis courts. Beginning in the 2019–2020 school year, after a successful pilot at Holicong Middle School, all sophomores and juniors received laptops as a part of the district’s 1:1 initiative for use in the classroom.
