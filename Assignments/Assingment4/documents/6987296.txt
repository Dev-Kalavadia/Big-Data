== New High School ==
In 2013, Eisenhower High School was torn down and replaced with a new building Northwest of the former school. The project cost the Yakima School District over $108 million. The development of the athletic amenities was a large reason to why the district had gone over the initial budget of $108 million. New athletic amenities included on campus baseball fields, tennis courts, soccer practice fields and football practice fields. These amenities added $7.3 million to the total cost of the project.

The new high school was built in a L-shaped configuration with the student commons being located at the corner. This design was incorporated to create loop circulation for the reduction of congestion and giving students alternate pathways to their destinations. By the student commons are the auditorium, foyer, gym, entry spaces, the administrative offices, and security offices. As a focal point, the school's entrance has a prominently positioned glass-enclosed public entry and second-story library. The academic spaces surround the central courtyard on three sides. This design allows natural light to shine into all of the classrooms. The fitness and weight facilities are located on the second floor and overlook the outdoor sports fields. The locker rooms are right underneath. Finally, the auditorium seats 800 people and has practice spaces down the hall. Following these practice space are practice spaces for the band and choir.

Since its unveiling in 2013, the new Eisenhower High School building has won several awards for its concept and design execution. These awards include the following: the AIA Central Washington Merit Award, the Learning by Design Outstanding Project Award, the MIW Excellence in Masonry Design Honor Award, the Inland Northwest AGC Build Northwest Award, and the Robert Faser Masonry Design Award.

=== KDA Architecture and Graham Construction Lawsuit ===
Six years after its opening in August, 2013, the Yakima School District filed a lawsuit against KDA Architecture because of design issues, and property damage of the building's signature blue wall. The lawsuit was about the specific changes that were made from initial design flaws. These changes contributed to the problems found throughout the building. The district also involved Graham Construction in the lawsuit for failing to install and effectively implement all elements of the design. The lawsuit states that in April 2013, the water-resistant material behind the tiles of the blue wall was melting. After further investigation, it was found that the tiles on the blue wall were heating up to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and causing them to melt. The Blue Wall hadn't been repaired until September 2017. The 750 foot wall cost the Yakima School District $547,280.

Additional flaws in the building were spotted by Eisenhower staff and faculty members after they had moved into the building in late August, 2013. After two months inside the new location, there were multiple reports of severe flaws, most notably water had been leaking through the wall and into the school's interior. The lawsuit also states that the leaking and damages were occurring because of the improper design, installation, poor workmanship, and a lack of flashing. In turn, the district had sued for over breach of contract and professional negligence amongst other things.

KDA Architecture and Graham Construction have yet to respond publicly on the lawsuit filed against them. Both have contributed in making repairs to the building and the blue wall, but not free of expenses. Both companies have continued projects in the Yakima Valley, including YV-Technical Institute.
