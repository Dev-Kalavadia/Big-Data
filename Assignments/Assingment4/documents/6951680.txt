==History==
Sant'Abbondio is first mentioned in 1192 as Sancto Abundio.

According to a document from 1358, the settlements of Martignoni de Ronco, Ronco di Sopra, Scimiana, Calgiano, Caviano and Scaiano had already grown up around the church of SS Abbondio e Andrea.  The church itself is first mentioned in 1364.  It was part of the parish of Vira, when it became the center of an independent parish.  In 1774, the villages of Ronco de Martignoni, Ronco di Sopra and Scimiana broke away from Sant'Abbondio to join the vice parish of Gerra.  Then, in 1850, they were followed by the settlement of Caviano and Scaiano.  The parish church of the new, smaller parish of Sant'Abbondio was rebuilt in the classicist style in 1852–53.

The local economy was based mostly on agriculture and pastoralism.  In the 19th Century, the emigration of decorators, painters and potters to France, provided another source of income.  In the second half of the 20th century Sant'Abbondio was developed for tourism and many second homes were built in the village.
