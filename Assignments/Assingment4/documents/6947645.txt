Title: Big Four (banking)


The Big Four (or Big 4) is the colloquial name given to the four main banks in several countries where the banking industry is dominated by just four institutions and where the phrase has thus gained relevance.BusinessDictionary.com, big banks, 2011. Some countries include more or fewer institutions in such rankings, leading to other names such as Big Three, Big Five, or Big Six.

New Zealand is Australia's closest neighbour, with very close cultural and economic ties. The big four Australian banks (often referred to collectively as the 'big banks'Parker, Tamsyn. NZ's big banks record $3.5b profit , The New Zealand Herald, 5 November 2013. Accessed 14 April 2014.Gray, Jamie. NZ's big banks under pressure , The New Zealand Herald, 5 August 2011. Accessed 14 April 2014. or the 'big Aussie banks') also dominate the banking sector in New Zealand, through subsidiaries:

* ANZ Bank New Zealand (ANZ), a subsidiary of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
* ASB Bank (ASB), formerly Auckland Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Commonwealth Bank of Australia
* Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), a subsidiary of the National Australia Bank
* Westpac New Zealand (WBC), formerly WestpacTrust after a merger with Trust Bank, a subsidiary of Westpac Banking Corporation

Together they hold over 90% of gross loans and advances in New Zealand as well as close to 90% of all mortgages.

These four NZ subsidiaries are massively profitable and in some cases even outperform the Australian parent companies.Westpac NZ outperforms Australian parent , The New Zealand Herald, 16 August 2011. Accessed 14 April 2014. The extent to which they dominate the banking sector can be seen in profits: In the 2012/2013 financial year, the largest of the Big Banks, ANZ New Zealand, made a profit of NZ$1.37 billion. The smallest, BNZ, made a profit of NZ$695 million. State-owned Kiwibank, community trust-owned TSB Bank, SBS Bank (formerly Southland Building Society) and Heartland Bank, the next four largest banks by profit, made NZ$97 million,Weir, James. Kiwibank lifts profit as customer base expands  NZ$73.5 million,TSB profit rises despite mortgage market competition , Radio New Zealand, 31 May 2013. Accessed 14 April 2014. NZ$14 million and NZ$7 million (albeit with an underlying result of about NZ$30 million) respectively. Thus, the profit of New Zealand's next four largest banks (after the Big Four) is equal to less than 30% of the smallest of the Big Four, BNZ.
