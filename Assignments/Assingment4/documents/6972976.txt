We had an enrollment of forty pupils with a very meager course of study embracing the following subjects: English, Latin, Greek, German, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting. The growth of the school is insignificant from 1906 to 1924, but from 1914 to the present day it has been phenomenal aa is evident from the following tabulation: In 1914 there were enrolled 150 pupils; 1915, 201; 1916, 240; 1917, 280; 1918, 297; 1919, 336; 1920. 379; 1921. 478; 1922, 614; 1923. 729; 1924, 778; 1925, 974, and at the present time, 1,103."
