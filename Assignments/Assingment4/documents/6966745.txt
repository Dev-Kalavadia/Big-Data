Jiffy Steamer, located in Union City, Tennessee, manufactures a variety of clothing steamers. Jiffy Steamer was founded in 1940.

==Product line development==
The company patented the Model J-1 hat steamer in 1940. Hats, such as fedoras, were a popular element of 1940s fashion. The common way of retaining a hat's shape was to place it over a steaming kettle of water. The J-1 was a standalone device that could do the same task without the requirement of a stove. The concept was later applied to the J-2 garment steamer, a larger version of the J-1 hat steamer that included a clothing rack. This product was aimed at the clothing industry to provide a way of removing wrinkles. The company now offers upgraded versions of the original J-2 clothes steamers, including the J-2000 steamer and several variants that provide different head attachments, and the J-4000, more geared towards the commercial marketplace. The company also manufactures a handheld steamer, the ESTEAM.
