Title: Milan Township, Allen County, Indiana
Milan Township is one of twenty townships in Allen County, Indiana, United States. Milan Township is located in east central Allen County, with the Maumee River meandering across the township. As of the 2010 census, its population was 3,749. The township is highly rural, with only 1,137 houses in the 2010 census. Many of the residents of Milan Township are Swiss Amish who mostly speak a Low Alemannic Alsatian dialect.[Chad Thompson: The Languages of the Amish of Allen County, Indiana: Multilingualism and Convergence], Anthropological Linguistics Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 1994), page 69. Milan township is generally demarcated by Schwartz Road to the west, Notestine Road to the north, Sampson Road to the east, and Gar Creek Road to the south.

==Towns and Villages==

The principal town in Milan Township is Milan Center, at 41°8'39"N 84°56'46"W.  Milan Center lies at the intersection of Milan Center Road and Doty Road, and at an earlier time consisted of Brueggemann's (previously Van Camp's,Fort Wayne Daily Gazette, 24 Jul 1878, Wed, Page 4 a combination lumberyard, gas station, hardware and grocery store), a small wood-frame church, Milan Center School, a feed mill, and four houses. Additional enterprises have come and gone through the years.Harris, R. D. (2019, February 26). Reflections by Roger. East Allen Courier, p. 1.

Brueggemann's Do-It-Best Center subsequently left to build a new store several miles removed to take advantage of traffic on State Highway 37 (at Ricker Road).  The original Milan Center structure subsequently was lost to fire, and the relocated Brueggemann's closed April 12, 2014 after 100 years of business.Long Time Family Business Closes Shop in New Haven. www.21alive.com, 12 Apr. 2014. Web.

Five Points is a settlement located at the junction of Old US Highway 24, Webster Road, and Woodburn Road, along the old Wabash-Erie Canal route. At one time it consisted of a small diner for truckers, a gas station (later a bicycle shop), a tile mill, and a few homes. A newer water tower labeled "Woodlan" near the Woodlan Schools may result in the community being known as "Woodlan" in the coming years.Churchward, Linda. "93 Allen County, Indiana Towns (Ghost) Past and Present." Allen County INgenWeb Project. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Dec. 2016

Gar Creek was once a shipping point on the Wabash and Toledo Railroad.  A small community of 500 people eventually settled around the station. In 1883, lumber and grain were the primary exports of the station.  Gar Creek enterprises at that time included a shingle manufacturer, two carpenters, a Justice of the Peace, a saw mill, a general store with a railway agent and a Postmaster (Jesse Rothgeb), a blacksmith, a hoop manufacturer, and United Brethren and Lutheran churches. The population at that time was listed as 130.Indiana State Gazetteer and Business Directory. Indianapolis, IN: R.L. Polk, 1882-1883. Print.

Thurman was a settlement located on the Detroit branch of the old Wabash Railroad. A few homes and businesses remain to this day.Churchward. Parts of Thurman were incorporated into Fort Wayne on March 31, 2008 as part of the "Schwartz Road Voluntary Annexation".Additional Schwartz Road Area Joins City. City of Fort Wayne. (2008). https://www.cityoffortwayne.org/latest-news/1192-additional-schwartz-road-area-joins-city.html.

==Woodlan Schools==
The Maumee-Milan Consolidated School System (constituents: Maumee Township, including the city of Woodburn, and Milan Township) built and dedicated Woodlan High School for the 1959–1960 school year.Schumacher, Tom and Messmann, Dulanna, ed. The Arrow. 1960 ed. Woodburn: Woodlan High School, n.d. Print. Located in Milan Township, the school lies just east of Five Points on the Woodburn Road. Students previously attending Harlan High School began attending Woodlan in the autumn of 1965, as the area's smaller school districts had been further consolidated into the East Allen County Schools a year earlier.Janssen, Sarah, "EACS Had Grass-Roots Start".  The (Fort Wayne) News-Sentinel. 14 January 2011. Web. 14 January 2011. Junior high and elementary schools are also now located on the campus.

==Economy==
The major industries in the county are agriculture, building trades, and rubber manufacturing.
The largest employer in the township is BF Goodrich.  The plant manufactures BF Goodrich and generic-branded tires for passenger cars and light trucks.  BF Goodrich is a division of Michelin North America.  As of 2016, 1,650 workers were employed at the facility located on Old U.S. Highway 24.
Shortly after opening in 1961, the mile-long plant was featured in the national media as the "longest" manufacturing facility in the country at the time. It has been upgraded and expanded subsequently several times.  The facility, which lies just east of the Woodlan Schools, comprises the highest-assessed real estate and business personal property value in the East Allen County Schools’ territory. 	 
Many plant employees are represented by United Steelworkers Local 715.Rodriguez, Rosa Salter. "Goodrich Seeks Tax Cut to Expand." The Journal Gazette. N.p., 13 Dec. 2016. Web. 13 Dec. 2016.

==Laventure’s Reserve==
The indigenous inhabitants of Milan Township were the Algonquian-speaking Miami People.
In the “Treaty with the Miami” executed on October 23, 1826, one section, 640 acres, of Milan Township land was reserved for “Laventure’s daughter”, whose father, Laventure Toucher, was a French trader and whose mother may have been a Miami."Treaty with The Miami - 1826." Native American Indian Treaties, First People of America. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Dec. 2016.

Laventure Toucher had been convicted of treason by the British in Fort Detroit in 1779 during the Revolutionary War.  The colonists had recruited neutral French inhabitants of the Detroit region to be spies and sympathizers for the American cause.Hoerauf, Geoffrey. “American Spies and Sympathizers at Fort Detroit (excerpts)”.  Early America. Varsity Tutors. Fall 1998. Web. 17 December 2016.

The reserved section occupied land bordered now by the Rohman and Platter roads. At the time of Indian Removal in 1846, those Miami who held separate allotments of land were allowed to stay as citizens in Indiana. Around 1872 the reserve was partially sold to non-native settlers, and by 1879, plat books were showing the “first family” Milan Township surnames of Lampe, Vondereau, Shafer, Bruick, Landin, and Yerks on that land."1879 Map of Milan Township." Plat Maps, 1880, Allen County, Indiana. Allen County Genealogical Society of Indiana, n.d. Web. 14 Dec. 2016.

Although the Indiana Miami were recognized by the US in an 1854 treaty, that recognition was stripped in 1897.  While an Indiana Miami Nation still exists to this day, the officially US-recognized relocated Miami Nation resides in Oklahoma. In 1980, the Indiana legislature recognized the Indiana Miami and voted to support federal recognition.• Rafert, Stewart (1996). The Miami Indians of Indiana; A Persistent People 1654-1994. Indiana Historical Society.• Tanner, Helen Horbeck (1987). Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History. Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press. .

==Early settlement prior to 1880==

Milan Township was first organized by the County Commissioners in March, 1838, being petitioned for, and named by, resident Stephen Heath, in honor of Milan Township, Huron County, Ohio: his former home (the township now resides in neighboring Erie County). The origin of the “Milan” name in Huron and Erie Counties, Ohio remains obscure.CCM Graphics, Inc. "The History of Milan, Ohio." Milanarea.com, n.d. Web. 18 Dec. 2016.

Charles Shriner erected the first frame house in 1838. It was attached to a log building. Alvin Hall erected the second frame house in 1841. William R. Herrick erected the first frame barn in the spring of 1850.Allen County Indiana Township Histories: Milan Township History Bits”. Genealogy Trails. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Dec. 2016.

The first road was surveyed in 1840 by Horace Taylor. It was called the Ridge Road, and extended from Fort Wayne to Hicksville, Ohio. The first stores in the township were operated by Stephen Heath and Lorenzo D. George.

The first township election was held in April, 1842; Andrew Wakefield was elected Justice of the Peace, and John Nettle, Constable. The positions were voluntary, as there were no salaries.

Amish settlement began in 1852–1853, when eleven wagons carrying fifty-two people, mainly recent immigrants from the Alsace, migrated to Allen County from Stark County, Ohio.[Chad Thompson: The Languages of the Amish of Allen County, Indiana: Multilingualism and Convergence], Anthropological Linguistics Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 1994), page 71.  Peter Graber was the first bishop. Three distinct divisions subsequently evolved in the community: the most-conservative Old Order Amish, the more progressive Amish-Mennonites, and the most liberal, the "Defenseless" (Egli) Mennonites.Hertig, Marquita & Fogle, Floyd, et al (2016). Harlan Indiana: Then and Now. Harlan, IN: Clover Printing Company, p.126

===The Village of Fairport===
The settlement of Fairport, the first village in the township, was created by Eastern venture capitalists attempting to capitalize on the newly created Wabash and Erie Canal.  The first post office was established at Fairport in 1843, with John Irvin being appointed Postmaster. Fairport straddled portions of Township Sections 13 and 24, in the far eastern part of the township, just south of the Maumee River.“Milan Township 1860 Plat Map”, acgsi.com

The heyday of the canal was 1847 to 1866, but the canal ultimately closed in 1878 as both shippers and passengers demonstrated a preference for utilizing the Wabash railroad instead, which had been built parallel to the canal."The Wabash-Erie Canal." Allen County (IN) Public Library. 1952.. Scribd, n.d. Web. 21 Dec. 2016. Fairport ultimately foundered as the canal foundered; the settlement became defunct and the site quickly reverted to farmland.

George Foxtater and John Irvin were the first tavern-keepers in the township, in Fairport.

===Chamberlain Settlement===
The village of Chamberlain arose when one of the first township settlers, Alvin Hall, requested that a post office be placed in the “western part of the township.” The request was granted, and Lorenzo D. George became the appointed postmaster. Chamberlain, located just southwest of Barnett Chapel on the Old Ridge Road in Section 4 of the township,“Map of Milan Township.” Allen County, Indiana. Allen County Map Co., 1907. began its own decline around 1870, and the post office was relocated to St. Joseph Township at that time.

==One-room district schoolhouses==
Support for rural public schools originated with the Federal Land Ordinance of 1785, which began the land surveys that laid out townships and sections across the growing nation. Every township was to consist of thirty-six sections containing 640 acres each. Section 16 and later, in 1848, section 36, were set aside to support schools.“One-Room Schoolhouses.” Encyclopedia of the Great Plains. University of Nebraska - Lincoln, 2011. Web. 17 Dec. 2016.
That ordinance largely failed in Indiana, but a few townships actually did use their surveyed “Section 16’s” for educational purposes, as prescribed in the ordinance.

Following statehood in 1816, the Indiana General Assembly then passed a complex series of acts (in 1824, 1849, and 1852) to organize and develop the public school system at the state, county, and township levels. School districts were created and given the authority to establish district schools at the township level. School district representatives were to be elected to the township trustees. State and local tax-support was provided on a county-by-county basis.

A number of schoolhouses were then built soon following 1852, but the majority were ultimately constructed following the Civil War. By 1900, over 8,000 one-room schools stood statewide.
Later, with changes in demographics and the onset of school consolidations, the General Assembly gave the State Superintendent the means to close districts where attendance was under 12 pupils.
Today there are over 700 surviving one-room schoolhouse structures in Indiana; the majority of these date from 1865 - 1900.“Indiana’s Public, Common and High Schools.”   Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology,   Web.  17 Dec. 2016.

Milan Township had at least 13 “District” schools.The Fort Wayne Sentinel, 6 Sep 1902, Sat, Page 2The Fort Wayne Sentinel, 7 Sep 1903, Mon, Page 5The Fort Wayne Sentinel, 23 Jan 1919, Thu, Page 9The Fort Wayne Sentinel, 29 Aug 1923, Wed, Page 13“Allen County, Indiana School Directory 1897-1921.” Genealogy Collection, Allen County Public Library.  Typewritten pages are library-bound and hand-numbered. No compilation date provided.

What was to become “District School No. 1” was actually the first school constructed in the township. It opened in a log building in 1845; the first teacher was Catherine Shell.  The structure was replaced by a frame building in 1857 when it officially became a District School. That building was erected by Alvin Hall, who was the first carpenter in the township."Allen County Indiana Township Histories: Milan Township History Bits”. Genealogy Trails. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Dec. 2016.

While "Brush College" appears to have been a popular designation at the time (i.e., the term was also used in Cedar Creek Township and in Huntington County), some muse that this one-room district schoolhouse in the "brushy woods" may have been a site to train teachers.Hertig, p.135.

==Cholera, malaria, and smallpox==
While all of these diseases are unheard of in the township today, each of these potentially life-ending scourges touched Milan Township at an earlier time. Groundbreaking on the Wabash and Erie Canal was 1832, and the canal was ultimately finished in 1856. Along the way to completion, it was said that a construction worker passed away from either cholera or malaria for every 6 feet of the canal being built.  The length of the canal was 452 miles, from Toledo, OH to Evansville, IN.

In November 1899 an epidemic of smallpox was “prevailing in Milan Township,” according to a Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette article from the time.  A cluster of cases six miles southeast of Maysville “in a heavily populated area” was described, apparently stretching to the Ohio Line.  Homes of infected individuals were placed under total police-supervised quarantine and all individuals exposed to those cases were placed under quarantine.  Milan Center School was ordered by the health department to be closed until the threat of contagion had passed.  Of interesting note was a particular smallpox-associated odor which could be detected outside each of the infected households.The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, 17 Nov 1899, Fri, Page 3

==Iron span bridges==

There are only two bridges spanning the Maumee River in Milan Township. The following original iron bridges have both been replaced with reinforced concrete structures.

===Platter’s Ford Bridge===
On July 1, 1876, the County Commissioners announced they were letting bids for the first township bridge to be built, at “Platter’s Ford”.The Fort Wayne Sentinel, 1 Jul 1876, Sat, Page 4
On August 15, the bid for the foundation was awarded to Chas. Bosseker & Co.  Nine additional bids for the iron supra-structure were also unsealed at the time.The Fort Wayne Sentinel, 16 Aug 1876, Wed, Page 4
In 1896 (and at several times following), a driftwood dam almost destroyed the completed structure,  which was described as having two 100-ft long iron spans suspended on a huge center pier.The Fort Wayne News, 29 Jul 1896, Wed, Page 1

===Schlink Farm Bridge===

It took residents multiple attempts over a four-period, petitioning County Commissioners, in order for the Schlink Bridge to be built.  Finally in 1906, the Commissioners met with residents on the site at the Schlink Farm to review the proposal, and it was thereafter finally agreed that the county would spend $15,000 to construct the iron bridge.Fort Wayne Daily News, 2 Jul 1902, Wed, Page 5The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, 17 Aug 1906, Fri, Page 4
The bridge on the Bruick Road is now a vital link connecting US Hwy 24 to northern township areas across the river.

==Cutting-edge mid-20th century technology==
In the mid-20th century, telephone communication across relatively short distances could be prohibitively expensive. Northern Milan township had traditionally been served by the Harlan telephone exchange, and southern Milan township by the New Haven telephone exchange. To make a call between differing exchanges, one could incur so-called "long distance" surcharges. Brueggemann's store at Milan Center served as a progressive business and community center by having telephones from both exchanges. The New Haven telephone exchange was purchased by the Home Telephone company in Fort Wayne, which was itself subsequently acquired by General Telephone of Indiana. The Harlan telephone company was also eventually acquired by General Telephone of Indiana. General Telephone is now a part of Verizon.Samoht, C. (2006). Recollections of Milan Township. Wikimedia. Published.

==Geology==
May Sand and Gravel once operated a stone quarry located along Old US 24, across from the BF Goodrich tire plant.  Core samples were collected by researchers Doheny, Droste, and Shaver from the Indiana Geological Survey and Indiana University in 1975.  The researchers catalogued a stratum of fossil sediment containing dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) and subsequently described its distribution from an origin in Northwestern Indiana, through veins to northeastern Indiana with varying thickness, erosion, and displacement by other strata along the way. 
Termed the “Milan Center Dolomite Member”, the name was taken from “Milan Center Township”[sic], in which the Woodburn Quarry was located.  This Milan Center Member was classified to be “Eifelian” in age.Doheny, Droste, and Shaver. "Milan Center Dolomite Member, Detroit River Formation, Devonian System." Indiana Geological Survey, n.d. Web. 14 Dec. 2016.

In later prehistory and into the frontier days, Milan Township laid nearly entirely within the far western area of a glacial valley described today as the Great Black Swamp.  Then in the 19th century, its wetlands were drained for travel, settlement, and agriculture. Stands of old-growth forests were felled and used for timber interests upon settlement."History of the Great Black Swamp." The Black Swamp Journal. Bowling Green State University, 14 Apr. 2011. Web. 14 Dec. 2016.  The Great Black Swamp extended eastward and downward from the old "Ridge Road," which is now Maysville Road.

The Maumee River flows through the township in a northeast course, and Twelve Mile and Ten Mile Creeks flow through the central part, joining the Maumee.  Six Mile Creek drains the southwestern part of the township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Milan Township covers an area of ; of this,  is land and , or 0.83%, is water.

===Historically significant churches===
The first township religious meeting was held at Catherine Shell's Ridge Road log schoolhouse, in 1845. Services were conducted by the Rev. True Pattee, affiliated with the M. E. Church.  The district schools were the first meeting places of various religious denominations, as no township church buildings were erected prior to 1880.
 
* Milan Evangelical Lutheran Church (Barnett Chapel) and Cemetery at State Road 37 and Barnett Road. Organized in 1864. Merged with St. Mark's Lutheran Church, Harlan (Springfield Township) in 1921. Now part of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church (see Springfield Township).
* St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church-Gar Creek and Cemetery at 1910 N. Berthaud Road. Organized in 1880 by members of Emanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church, New Haven. Birth, baptism, confirmation, marriage and death records exist since 1880. Early records in German. Records have been photocopied and are available at the Allen County Public Library.
* Milan Center Methodist Protestant Church at the corner of Doty and Milan Center Roads. Organized in 1905/06 when a series of meetings were held in the old Milan Center schoolhouse. Land was donated and construction on the church was begun in 1906. Church disbanded sometime after 1954. Records may be located at the DePauw University Library, Greencastle, IN. The church building has been utilized by various congregations since.
* The Gar Creek Mennonite Church is also now defunct. In about 1854, Mennonites first settled at Gar Creek, a village 11 miles (18 km) northeast of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Among them Michael Rothgeb, Abram and Jacob Bixler, John Federspiel, Hezekiah Rothgeb, and Nancy Lowery. Services were held in Bethel Chapel, a union building. There was no resident minister. Eli Stoffer, a minister in the Hudson (Indiana) congregation, and others conducted occasional services. In 1900 there were 20 members. After the establishing of the Fort Wayne Mission in 1903, the mission workers assumed responsibility for the services at Gar Creek. On 22 October 1905 the building was rededicated for church services. Regular services were discontinued about 1910.Osborne, Hubert L. "Gar Creek Mennonite Church (Gar Creek, Indiana, USA)."
