Title: Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment
The UK Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment (ILGRA) was "an informal committee of officials responsible for policy development and practical applications of risk assessment in all major Departments."Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment Official website 

The overriding purpose of ILGRA is to "secure coherence and consistency within and between policy and practice in risk assessment as undertaken by Government, and help disseminate and advance good practice."ILGRA Report 2002 The Precautionary Principle: Policy and Application It achieves these aims through holding regular meetings, at which risk assessment issues are discussed. Reports are then prepared by ILGRA members to ministers in the relevant UK Government departments.

ILGRA meetings and resultant reports tend to focus predominantly on health, safety and environmental risks, although its remit is not confined to this areas exclusively.
