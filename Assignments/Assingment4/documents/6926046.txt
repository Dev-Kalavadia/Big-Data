The village was first mentioned in 1530 as Opeyndt. The name Harkema means "settlement of the descendants of Buwe Harkema. In 1972, the name was officially changed from Opeinde to Harkema.

In 1840, it was home to 484 people. In 1883, a church was opened in a wooden shed, and was replaced in 1891 by a real church. The church was too small, and replaced by the current church in 1913. In the 1960s, Harkema experienced growth and started to attract industry.
