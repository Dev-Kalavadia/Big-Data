Title: Keep This Fire Burning



"Keep This Fire Burning" is a song by Swedish recording artist Robyn, released as the first single from her third album Don't Stop the Music. The single was released in Sweden on 21 September 2002, where it became her highest charting single since 1995's "Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)". The song was also released as a single in Australia under the name "By Your Side" due to the Australian bushfires which were happening at the time. In 2008, a re-recorded version of the song appeared on the special edition of Robyn's eponymous album.

British soul singer Beverley Knight released a cover of the song in 2004.

==Beverley Knight version==

British soul singer Beverley Knight recorded a cover version of "Keep This Fire Burning" and released it as the third and final single from her fourth studio album, Affirmation (2004), on 14 March 2005. The production of the song, handled by Ghost, used the exact same instrumental as Robyn's original version, with slight mixing differences and additional orchestration by the Stockholm Session Strings. Included on the CD single release were mixes from Stargate (which sampled a portion of Robyn's original vocals) and Full Phat (featuring a rap from Estelle). "Keep This Fire Burning" became Knight's sixth top-20 solo single in the UK, reaching number 16.
