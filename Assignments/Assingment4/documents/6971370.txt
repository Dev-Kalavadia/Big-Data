Title: SuperMelodrama


SuperMelodrama is the first album by the band DeVotchKa. It was released by Dago Records in 2000. It was recorded partly at Absinthe Studios, in Westminster, Colorado.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic wrote that the band mixes "regular references to European folk, hints of sunny pop melodies, and angular post-punk ruminations via a mesh of clarinet, accordion, sousaphone, trumpet, percussion, and violin falling over the staggering peaks of the traditional rock & roll bed of guitar, bass, and drums." Global Rhythm praised the "raucous surf-gypsy leanings."
