Title: Code page 775

Code page 775 (CCSID 775) (also known as CP 775, IBM 00775, and OEM 775, MS-DOS Baltic Rim) is a code page used under DOS to write the Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian languages. In Lithuania, this code page is standardised as LST 1590-1, alongside the related Code page 778 (LST 1590-2).

It is possible, but unusual, to write Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Danish and German using this code page due to it including all the characters in ISO 8859-13. The other code page used for Baltic languages is Windows-1257.
