==History==
The school was built in 1921. It had two floors with the first floor having four rooms, with two classes in each room. The first floor was used for grades 1 through 8, and the second floor was used for assemblies. The school also had a stage with rooms on either side for a kitchen and a library. At the rear of the building were restrooms and a water trough. It remained in use until its closure in 1977.

The school has since been renovated and converted into the Bostwick Library, a branch of the Putnam County Library System. Renovation was completed on December 4, 2007.
