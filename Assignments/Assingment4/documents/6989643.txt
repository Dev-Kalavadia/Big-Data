Title: Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?



Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats? is an UNKLE soundscape DJ mix, originally recorded for Radio Ape in Japan, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Beats was the first in a line of a series of UNKLESounds mixes. Due to its huge success (reaching over £100 on eBay) it was bootlegged and can now be found in most record stores.

The name references the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by sci fi author Philip K. Dick. The mix was later released as a cut down and re-edited 2CD mix entitled Big Brother is Watching (a reference to another sci fi novel, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four), which was broadcast on the Essential Mix at UK radio station Radio 1.
