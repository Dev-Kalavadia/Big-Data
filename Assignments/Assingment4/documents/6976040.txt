Title: The Secret Value of Daydreaming


The Secret Value of Daydreaming is the second studio album by singer-songwriter Julian Lennon.

==Background and recording==
After going on tour the previous year to promote his previous album, Valotte, Lennon took a break to write material for The Secret Value of Daydreaming. Recording took place in the Bahamas, at Compass Point Studios, with mixing at the Hit Factory in New York City.

==Release==

The Secret Value of Daydreaming was released on 24 March 1986 on Charisma in the UK, and a day later on the 25th on Atlantic in the US. The album peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart upon its release. It was certified gold for sales of over 500,000 copies in the US by the RIAA on 22 May 1986. "Stick Around" reached number 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and number 32 on their Hot 100 chart.

Musician reviewer J. D. Considine wrote simply: "At least he got his father's looks."

The album was reissued, along with Mr. Jordan and Help Yourself, on 8 September 2009 by Noble Rot Records.
