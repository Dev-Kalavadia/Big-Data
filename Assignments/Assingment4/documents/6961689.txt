==Etymology==

The name refers to cocker, a breeder of, hunter of, or fighter with game birds. This is appropriate given the local farming of poultry and the presence of many partridge and other game birds in the surrounding area.

==Water quality and pollution==

The River Cocker, along with its neighbour the River Conder lie within the Pilling, Ridgy, Cocker and Conder Operational Catchment of the Environment Agency's Lune Management Catchment. The area is heavily pastorally farmed, with extensive cattle, sheep and poultry stock and agricultural pollution is identified as the main reason that waters have yet to attain “Good” status.The Lune Management Catchment, A summary of information about the water environment in the Lune management catchment, Environment Agency. https://circabc.europa.eu/webdav/CircaBC/env/wfd/Library/framework_directive/implementation_documents_1/2012-2014%20WFD%20public%20information%20and%20consultation%20documents/UK/UK12%20North%20West/Lune.pdf

United Utilities has made funding available for the “Cocker and Conder Clean Up”. Recent reporting has identified the overall quality of the water as “Moderate” for environmental pollution (ammonia and phosphates) and “Good” for chemical contamination.
