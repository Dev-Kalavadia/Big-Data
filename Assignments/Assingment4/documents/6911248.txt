Title: Leonid Pozen



Leonid Vladimirovitch Pozen (1849â€“1921) was a Russo-Ukrainian  sculptor and politician. Most of his works were made using wax and then cast in bronze at the K. Werfel factory in St Petersburg. His early works show his attraction to animal sculpture. His realism placed Pozen alongside the painters Vasily Perov, Grigory Myasoyedov, and Ivan Kramskoy.
