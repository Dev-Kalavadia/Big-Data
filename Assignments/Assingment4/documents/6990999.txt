Title: Huntington Bank Pavilion


Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island is an outdoor amphitheater located on the man-made peninsula Northerly Island, in Chicago, Illinois.  The venue is a temporary structure, with the summer concert season running from May or June until September or October.  The amphitheater opened in June 2005.  It was previously named the FirstMerit Bank Pavilion, and before that the Charter One Pavilion.McKeough, Kevin (June 30, 2013). "Review: Jimmy Buffett Delivers, but Northerly Island Doesn't", Chicago Tribune. 

Known as the "Venue with a View",  the amphitheater has views of Lake Michigan, Burnham Harbor, Soldier Field, and the Chicago skyline.

==History==
The venue lies on the former site of Meigs Field. On March 30, 2003, Mayor Richard M. Daley ordered a midnight demolition of the airfield. The construction crew excavated six large X's on the runway. Daley stated the continued operation of the airfield was a threat to Chicago's cityscape, using the events of 9/11 as a reference. The airfield was set to continue operation until 2011, when it would be turned over to the City of Chicago. No one within state or city government were consulted on the demolition besides Daley. The Federal Aviation Administration fined the city $33,000, with an additional one million paid in grants.

In August 2003, construction crews were sent in to continue demolition of the airfield. Originally, the space was planned to become an aviation museum. Daley refuted the plan and proposed the space become a lakefront park and nature reserve. Within the allocated 91 acres, Northerly Island was born. Over four acres were set aside for the forthcoming music venue.

==About the venue==
With the new advent of the nature reserve to replace Meigs Field, the Chicago Park District proposed an outdoor music venue, similar to the Ravinia Pavilion. Construction began in December 2004. Since the venue would be located on the nature reserve, the structure would be erected in June and disassembled in September of each year. The venue was designed by Mark Dewalt of Valerio Dewalt Train Associates; costing $1.7 million to construct. The amphitheater features a 56' × 40' stage with 15' × 20' video screens on either side of the stage. It features three grandstands (totaling 3,666 seats) and a general admission area (totaling 4,500 seats). The Chicago Park District receives roughly $250,000 from the venue (through sponsorship deals) and $1 from every ticket sold during concert season. The venue opened June 24, 2005, with a concert by American band Earth, Wind & Fire.


After the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue implemented a new bag policy at their events. To reduce staff contact with guest belongings, they allow clear plastic, vinyl or PVC tote bags no larger than 12” x 6” x 12” and/or small clutch bags (4.5”x 6.5”). No other bags of any type will be allowed.

==2013 expansion==

The Chicago Park District originally sought expansion in 2010, wanting to increase capacity to 14,000 and attract mainstream acts to the venue. The city voted against the expansion in 2011. In March 2013, the Chicago Plan Commission approved a $3 million plan to grow the venue's capacity from 8,000 to 30,000 seats. This would mean rotating the stage to feature a lawn seating area, increasing the overall space of the venue from 4.78 to 6.9 acres. Additionally, two 300-seat grandstands were added, while the lawn arena can accommodate 22,000. There's a 12-foot slope from the front of stage to the rear of lawn, providing the proper elevation change so that the lawn can be used as a park area when not in use by the pavilion. The expansion also includes shuttle buses from the neighboring Soldier Field to help concert attendees with parking. The main entrance was widened to accommodate the capacity expansion. Delay systems for sound were added to the stage and lawn area. The original video screens were replaced by two 14' × 27' LED screens and two 11' × 17' LED screens in the lawn area.

The newly renovated venue was expected to open June 27, 2013. However, due to heavy rainfall the opening was postponed. Concerts by Dispatch and O.A.R. were relocated to the UIC Pavilion. It was opened on June 29, 2013 by Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band.

==Naming==
Upon original conception, the venue was known as the Lakefront Pavilion. On June 22, 2005, it was announced Charter One Financial purchased naming rights for five years, for $2.5 million. From 2005 until 2013, the venue was known as the Charter One Pavilion at Northerly Island. With new construction underway, it was revealed the venue was seeking a new sponsorship deal. In June 2013, Ohio-based FirstMerit Corporation purchased a multi-year naming rights agreement. The length of the contract and amount were not disclosed. From June 27, 2013 until January 8, 2017 the venue was known as the FirstMerit Bank Pavilion. Huntington Bank acquired FirstMerit Bank near the end of 2016. On January 9, 2017 the venue name was changed to reflect this. The venue is now known as Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island.
