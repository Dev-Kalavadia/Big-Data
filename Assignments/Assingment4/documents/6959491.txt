==Tennis career==
As a junior player, Radwańska won Grand Slam titles, including the 2007 Wimbledon girls' singles, culminating in the junior year-ending world No. 1 ranking. This was the launching pad into her professional career, where she has been getting into WTA main draws via qualifying and wildcards.

In 2007, Radwańska played in the main draw of three WTA Tour tournaments. She lost in the first round of the Tier II Warsaw Open in Warsaw, the second round of the Tier III Japan Open in Tokyo, and the quarterfinals of the Tier III Bangkok Open after defeating fourth-seeded Virginie Razzano in the third round. Urszula and Agnieszka won a doubles title together at the İstanbul Cup.

At the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, Radwańska made her Grand Slam singles debut, losing in the second round to two-time champion Serena Williams 4–6, 4–6. Having seen the fight she put up in this match, the commentator Andrew Castle observed: "She is sound in just about all areas, and she knows what to do with the ball, she seems to have an understanding, a little like Martina Hingis."
