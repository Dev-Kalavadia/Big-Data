Title: All the Stars and Boulevards

All the Stars and Boulevards is the debut album by American rock band Augustana The album was released September 6, 2005, by Epic Records.

The album's release went largely unnoticed at the time. However, the single "Boston" was used during an episode of the CW series One Tree Hill in 2006 and propelled the band into national prominence. As a result, the song was used in several other MTV and VH1 shows, and Augustana was selected as a "You Oughta Know" band by VH1.Augustana | Music Artist, Videos, Photos, News, Ringtones, Album and Movie Info | VH1.com The album was then selectively re-released on September 12, 2006. "Boston" continued to be used on television into 2007, including in episodes of the series Scrubs, Shark, and The Big Bang Theory.

== Critical reception ==

All the Stars and Boulevards garnered a mixed reception from music critics. Gavin Edwards of Rolling Stone found the production, honest lyrics and guitar work mixing well with each other in O'Brien's control, saying that "Augustana are ready for their guest appearance on just about any WB show (OK, maybe not Reba)." Tim Sendra of AllMusic said that the band's influences that make up their overall sound felt inauthentic, with production, instrumentals and vocal dexterity being put through the studio cycle. But Sendra said that "the album is still listenable in a strange kind of way[,] since the lack of any distinguishing features allows the music to be perfect background music." Bud Scoopa of Paste said that, despite the album being well produced, he found dissonance between the lyrics and instruments mixing together.
