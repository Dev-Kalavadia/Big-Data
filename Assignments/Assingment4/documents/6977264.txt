Title: Ulmus 'Morton Glossy'


Ulmus 'Morton Glossy' (selling name ) is a hybrid cultivar raised by the Morton Arboretum, Illinois. Originally named 'Charisma' until it was realized that name had already been registered for another plant, the tree was derived from a crossing of two other hybrid cultivars grown at the Morton:  and . Tested in the US National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University,   averaged a survival rate of 86% after 10 years.  was introduced to the UK in 2006 by the Frank P. Matthews nursery in Worcestershire.Brookes, A. H. (2020). Great Fontley Elm Trial, 2020 Report.  Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, UK.

==Description==
 has been promoted in the United States as "strong and symmetrical" in growth and habit  . However, its performance in the southern United States has not impressed, and it was dismissed as "ugly" by Michael Dirr, Professor of Horticulture at the University of Georgia , on account of its "wild" growth and splaying branches. It is similar in stature to the American Elm and has leaves that are a deep glossy green when mature, < 10 cm in length by 5 cm broad, with rough upper surface and finely toothed margins. The samara is comparatively small, < 10 mm long by 8 mm wide, the seed central. In trials in the UK,  was found to be the first elm cultivar to flush in spring, and the first to shed its leaves in the fall, usually by early October. The tree grew poorly on thin soils over clay, which became very dry in summer, but excelled on floodplain alluvium subjected to brief periods of inundation in winter.

==Cultivation==
In commerce,  is usually propagated by grafting onto an Ulmus pumila rootstock. The tree, under its original name of 'Charisma', featured in the elm trials  conducted by Northern Arizona University at Holbrook, eastern Arizona.  is very cold-hardy; in artificial freezing tests at the arboretum Shirazi, A. M. & Ware, G. H. (2004). Evaluation of New Elms from China for Cold Hardiness in Northern Latitudes. International Symposium on Asian Plant Diversity & Systematics 2004, Sakura, Japan. the LT50 (temp. at which 50% of tissues die) was found to be −40 °C.

The tree is currently being evaluated in the National Elm Trial coordinated by Colorado State University.  was briefly in commerce in the UK, where 180 trees were sold in 2006; several specimens were acquired for assessment by Butterfly Conservation in Hampshire.
