==History==

Lodrino is first mentioned in 857 as Ludrini.  In 1193 it was mentioned as Ludrino.

Remains of fortifications suggest that in the 12th and 13th century a noble family, perhaps from Lombardy, lived in Lodrino.  During the Middle Ages, Lodrino also included the hamlet of Prosito (called Proxedrium in the 13th century).  Until the mid-15th century, Prosito probably had the same status as Lodrino and Iragna.  The hamlets on the mountainside formed the community of Monte Parli, which was first mentioned in 1207.

The parish church of SS Gervasio e Protasio in Prosito was built in the 13th century and was, perhaps, a private church.  The center Monte Parli was the Chapel of San Martino di Monte Paglio, which was built in 1215.  It was originally the parish church of the hamlets and was known as SS Placido e Sigisberto.  The main church in Lodrino was the church of St. Ambrogio which was first mentioned in 1375.  It was built on the foundation of a romanesque church from the 11th-12th centuries.  The churches were supported in the Middle Ages by the Vicar of Biasca.  When the Duke of Milan ceded the Levantine to Uri in 1441, he reorganized his holdings in the Riviera.  The villages Lodrino, Prosito and Iragna were incorporated in a ducal vicariate, which was allowed to elect their own village officials.  In the administration as well as civil and criminal law the villages were given considerable autonomy.  They were given village statutes of 1450 and again in 1492.  In 1496 Lodrino, Prosito and Iragna swore their loyalty to the Swiss Confederation.

In past centuries, the population lived on agriculture and livestock.  Between 1782-1869 there was a glass factory and a little temporary textile industry in the village.  The construction of the Gotthard railway required a number of granite quarries to supply stone for the project.  Some of the quarries are still in operation in spite of a strong and steady decline of the workforce.  In 1939, the so-called Lona-line (Lodrino-Osogna) was built, a  long fortified line with 23 anti-tank forts.  Since 1943, a small military airfield, the Lodrino Air Base, has been in operation.  It is now also used as a civilian helicopter landing site.  In the last decades of the 20th century there was major construction activity in the municipality.  Many new homes as well as schools (primary and advanced) and sports facilities were built.
