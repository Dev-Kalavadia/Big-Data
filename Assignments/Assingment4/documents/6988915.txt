Title: Samoa national cricket team




The Samoan national cricket team is the men's team that represents Samoa in international cricket. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2000. They competed in the Pacifica Championship in 2001 and 2002, hosting the tournament on the second occasion. They came 6th in 2001, and 5th in 2002. In 2005, they competed in the East Asia/Pacific Cup, finishing in last place, thus missing out on qualification for the 2011 World Cup. Since 2017, they became an associate member.

==History==
In February 1966, Prime Minister Fiamē Mataʻafa Faumuina Mulinuʻu II banned cricket from being played except on Wednesdays and Saturdays, stating it was distracting Samoans from cleaning up after a cyclone. A cricket match in Samoa in October 1977 ended in a fight in which two players were stabbed to death. According to the Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, "the row started after a player was bowled out and angrily hit the wicket with his bat".

===2018–present===
In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Samoa and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 has been a full T20I.

Samoa played their first T20I against Papua New Guinea during the 2019 Pacific Games.
