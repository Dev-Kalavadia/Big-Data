Lincolnwood School District 74 is a public school  headquartered Lincolnwood, Illinois.


==History==
It was created in 1938, with Lincoln Hall as the only school at the time.

In January 2012, several Lincolnwood residents became concerned with the finances in School District 74. After using a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request the residents discovered the School Board President, other School Board Members, and the Superintendent Mark Klaisner were discovered to have spent tens of thousands of dollars on trips, cellphone service, gasoline for personal use.  The local CBS affiliate did a story on the overspending. In an interview in the Skokie Patch, Superintendent Dr. Mark A. Klaisner admitted to poor internal controls and being "completely unaware" of details of the car provided by taxpayers. The School Board extended the contract of Superintendent Dr. Mark A. Klaisner. On April 9, 2012, School Board President Amy Frankel resigned as first reported in the Skokie Patch,. On April 17, retired superintendent Ken Cull (formerly Itasca District 10) was elected interim superintendent through June 2012.

Joseph Bailey was scheduled to retire as superintendent in June 2017, and in 2016 the district's board selected Kimberly "Kim" Nasshan as his replacement.
