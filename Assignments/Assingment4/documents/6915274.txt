==History==
The chain was founded by a young family of Italian immigrants—consisting of Sam Primucci, and his brothers Mike, Vince, and Joe—originating from Basilicata, Italy. Their first location opened on 12 May 1963 at the corner of Lawrence Avenue East, just west of Kennedy Road.

Following many years of success in both their delivery and walk-in services, the restaurant opened their first franchised store in 1969.

Upon celebrating the company's 50th anniversary, the pizza chain also announced their partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays and the Rogers Centre as their official pizza supplier, starting in January 2014, and continuing for a three-year agreement.

==Jingle==
In October 1987, jingle writer Syd Kessler, advertising agency Montana Steele, and Pizza Nova President Sam Primucci produced an advertisement featuring the singing of the phone number and vocalising the quadruple zero as "4-3-9, Oh-Oh Oh-Oh Pizza Nova!" Sung by Canadian musician Zappacosta, edits of the original can still be heard on Ontario radio and TV today, with new voiceover by company President Domenic Primucci, son of founder Sam Primucci.
