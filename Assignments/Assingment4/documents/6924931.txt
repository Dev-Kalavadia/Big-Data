==History==
Until October 1962, when the initial wing of Cresskill's high school, constructed at a cost of $2.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ), was opened, Cresskill's students in grades seven to twelve had attended Tenafly High School. Students already in the Tenafly district for grades 11 and 12 when the Cresskill school opened remained at Tenafly High School until graduation, which meant that the first Cresskill graduating class was the Class of 1965.Slocum, John W. "New Jersey; Bergen", The New York Times, September 3, 1962. Accessed July 22, 2011. "Cresskill will open the first wing of its $2,800,000 high school on Oct 1.
