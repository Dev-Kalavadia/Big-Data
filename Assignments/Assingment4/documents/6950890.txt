Mosogno is first mentioned in 1277 as Mosogno.  In 1352 it was mentioned as Muxognio. In the Middle Ages, it was one of the five Squadre that made up the community of Onsernone.  It became an independent municipality in 1803.

The church of S. Bernardo was built along the road in 1596.  It became parish church and center of its own parish after it separated from Loco in 1685.  The settlement of Mosogno Sotto has had the Chapel St. Maria Addolorata since 1684.  In 1657 the chapel of S. Maria della Natività was built in Bairon, while in Chiosso the chapel of S. Giacomo was built in the second half of the 17th Century.

The decline of the straw factory, emigration and recent migration to urban centers, have led to a steady decline in population since the late 19th Century.
