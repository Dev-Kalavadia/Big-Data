Two tambons of Hankha district, Chai Nat province and two tambons of Bang Rachan district, Sing Buri province were added. In 1939 the government changed the district name of Nang Buat District to Sam Chuk, they decided to put the word Nang Buat after Doem Bang, so since that year the district is named Doem Bang Nang Buat.
