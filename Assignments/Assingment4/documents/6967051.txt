Gravesano is first mentioned in 1254 as de Gravaxana.

Gravesano also includes the hamlet of Grumo, that was home to a medieval castle that ruled over both villages as well as Manno and Bedano.  The castle, which was on the road from Ponte Tresa to Monte Ceneri Pass, was visited in 1004 by Emperor Henry II and later by Frederick Barbarossa during his Italy campaign in 1162.  The monastery of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro of Pavia and the Bishop of Como both held property and rights in Gravesano.  The S. Pietro parish, which also included Manno and Bedano, was set up in 1609 in Gravesano.  The church is mentioned in 1192, and the present building dates from the late 16th Century.  In 1893, the Foundation Matteo Rusca established a secondary school and art school in the village.
