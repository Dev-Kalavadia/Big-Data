Title: Post-reform radiate


The post-reform radiate (the Latin name, like many Roman coins of this time, is unknown), was a Roman coin first issued by Diocletian during his currency reforms. The radiate looked very similar to the antoninianus (pre-reform radiate), with a radiate crown, similar to the one worn by the Roman deity, Sol Invictus. It is different from the Antoninianus because of the absence of the "XXI" that existed on pre-reform radiates, a symbol believed to have indicated a consistence of 20 parts bronze to 1 part silver. The post-reform radiate had little or no silver content.
