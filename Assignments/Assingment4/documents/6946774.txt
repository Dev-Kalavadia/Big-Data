Bodmin Airfield was the development of a dream by local business man, Mike Robertson, founder of Trago Mills, to make aviation available to everyone. In pursuit of this dream, local engineers, The Dingle Brothers were commissioned to construct the airfield on what was once Treswithick Farm. In 1972, the airfield was bought by the Cornwall Flying Club, which, in turn, became a limited company, Cornwall Flying Club Ltd, in 1978. In keeping with the original ideals and dreams of its creator, Cornwall Flying Club operates as a non-profit organisation, to keep costs down to the end user.Cornwall Flying Club website

It was here that Trago Mills Ltd. (Aviation Division) designed and built the Trago Mills SAH-1 in the early 1980s. The SAH-1 derived its name from its designer, Sydney A. Holloway. It was hoped that the Trago Mills SAH-1 would be sold as a military trainer to replace the then ageing "Bulldog" fleet.Peter London: Images of aviation In Cornish Skies page 114
