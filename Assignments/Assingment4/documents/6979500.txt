Title: 1913 Finnish parliamentary election

Parliamentary elections were held in the Grand Duchy of Finland on 1 and 2 August 1913. In 1914, the Russian government decided to suspend the Finnish Parliament for the duration of World War I.

Finnish voters' growing frustration with Parliament's performance was reflected by the low voter turnout; the Social Democrats and Agrarians, championing the cause of poor workers and farmers, kept gaining votes at the expense of the Old Finns, whose main concern was the passive defence of Finland's self-government. They disagreed on the social and economic policies, and thus did not formulate very clear positions on them.Seppo Zetterberg et al (2008) A Small Giant of the Finnish History WSOJAllan Tiitta and Seppo Zetterberg (1992) Finland Through the Ages Reader's Digest
