Historical records indicate he died in the Chhota ghallughara (holocaust) in 1746, while defending the Sikh community, from Afghan attacks. Bhuma Singh was childless so he adopted his nephew as his son, Hari Singh Dhillon. On Bhuma Singh's death in 1746, his nephew and adopted son, Hari Singh Dhillon, assumed the leadership of the Bhangi Misl. The Bhangi Misl got its name from the addiction of Hashish(Bhang) of Bhuma Singh Dhillon.
