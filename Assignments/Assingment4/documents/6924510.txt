Title: Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Championships
The Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) holds National Championships in seven different categories: 
*Coed Dinghy
*Women’s Dinghy 
*Team Racing
*Women's Team Racing
*Men’s Singlehanded
*Women’s Singlehanded 
*Match Racing (previously Sloop)


The college team that compiles the best overall record in the six categories is awarded the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy.

Teams must qualify for the National Championships through conference championships. All regattas are scored low-point with no throw-out races. Racing is done on short courses. Boats are usually rotated each race so that each team sails each boat in the fleet once. 

The ICSA National Championships rotate amongst ICSA's seven different conferences each year.

Since college sailing is a fall and spring sport, three of these championships are held in the fall and three are held in the spring.National Championships 

== Fall ==
Women’s Single-handed, Men’s Single-Handed, and Match Racing Championships are conducted in the fall. The single handed championships are usually sailed during a single regatta in early November in builder-supplied Lasers (men) Laser Radials (women).

== Spring ==
Women’s Dinghy, Coed Dinghy, and Team Racing Championships take place in the spring, at the ICSA National Championship Regatta, in May. It's hosted by a member school of the Intercollegiate Sailing Association. The most prestigious of these categories, by tradition and stature, is the Coed Dinghy Championship, the oldest of the national championships (sailed since 1937) and if a school wins this event they are considered to have won THE national championship.Coed Championships
