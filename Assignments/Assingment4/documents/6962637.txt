Title: Wes King


Wes King (born January 20, 1966) is an American contemporary Christian singer, songwriter, photographer, and musician. He is perhaps best known for his 1993 album The Robe. His demo material, a cassette tape named "Lonely Poet", is sung by other artists, such as Kim Hill. He briefly attended Covenant College outside of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the late 1980s. He also led worship at Christian youth retreat camps.

==Background==
After picking up the guitar at the age of 14, Wes wrote his first songs two years later; after studying the Bible at Covenant College, he relocated to Franklin, Tennessee. Wes signed with Reunion Records and recorded his first solo LP The Ultimate Underlying No Denying Motivation in 1990. After issuing Sticks and Stones a year later, King resurfaced in 1993 with The Robe. 1995's Common Creed was his biggest hit to date, notching three CHR chart-toppers -- "Life Is Precious," "The Love of Christ" and the title cut. In 1997, King issued A Room Full of Stories, his most acclaimed effort yet followed by What Matters Most in 2000 which was released on Word Artisan.

In 2005 Wes was diagnosed with Lymphoma and underwent many months of extremely difficult treatments and years of side-effects. Wes is now cancer free and is feeling well enough to spend time in his studio again. 

Wes King's song "Good to Be Alive" is a song of celebration and thankfulness for the life the Lord has given him. Other free downloadable singles include, "Point to the Light", "My Dear Mother" (written as a dedication to his close mother who passed just months before), and "The Robe" (remixed/mash-up as "The Robe / Come as You Are" by Masaki).
