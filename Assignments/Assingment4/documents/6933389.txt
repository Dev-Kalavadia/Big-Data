Title: Jackson Island


Jackson Island (, Ostrov Dzheksona) is an island located in Franz Josef Land, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russian Federation. This island is part of the Zichy Land subgroup of the central part of the archipelago.

==Geography==
Jackson Island's east–west extension is about , and the maximum distance from north to south is .

On the northwest shore of the island is De Long Bay. Named after ill-fated American Arctic explorer George W. De Long, this bay separates the island into two almost even peninsulas.  From the south, this bay is bounded by Cape Bystrova, named in 1963 in honor of outstanding Russian paleontologist A.P. Bystrow.

Jackson Island is named in honor of English polar voyager Frederick Jackson. He explored and named several islands, among other geographical features, in Franz Josef Land.  The Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic Expedition (1894–1897) was sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society.

==History==
Cape Norway () on the western part of the island was where Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen wintered in 1895-96 after failing to reach the North Pole.  A hut and a wooden post still remain.

*Alexander Islands (Острова Александра) is a group of small islands located right off the northwestern tip of Jackson Island, close to the shore. Sputnik Island is located at lat 81° 21' N; long 55° 35' E. This island group might have been named after Field Marshal Alexander von Krobatin (1849–1933), a supporter of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition, who served as Austria-Hungary's Minister of War from 1912 to 1917. However the connection to the Austro-Hungarian expedition is dubious, as these islands were only discovered by Nansen in 1895. The maps of the Austro-Hungarian expedition make it clear that they could not see far into Back's Strait, leaving the Alexander Islands out of their view."Map of Franz Josef Land from a Survey by Julius Payer" in  It is also possible that Nansen named this island after his brother, , considering he named other islands for his wife, daughter, mother, and friend, respectively. These small islands should not be confused with Alexandra Land located westwards in the same archipelago.
