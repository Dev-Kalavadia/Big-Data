Title: Finishing the Game

Finishing the Game is a 2007 mockumentary film directed by Justin Lin focusing on Bruce Lee's final movie Game of Death (1972), which was unfinished at the time of his death.Lee died having shot only 40 minutes of the fight scenes, and so the film was completed to include just 12 minutes of Lee's fighting, using Bruce Lee body doubles, and "clips snatched from previous films, even clips from Lee’s own Hong Kong funeral." Robert Ito of The New York Times describes the finished product, "which includes about 12 minutes of Lee’s original fight scenes" as "grotesque." See Ito, "50 Guys...", op. cit. Shot in 18 days,Finishing the Game comically satirizes the 1972 production—which used body doubles and clips from other Lee movies—and addresses racial stereotypes on the Asian community.

Its world premiere took place at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, where it was an Official Selection. It was also selected as the opening night film at the 25th San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival.
