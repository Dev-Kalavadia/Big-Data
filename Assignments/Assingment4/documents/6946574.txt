Title: Lapdance (song)

"Lapdance" is a song by American rock/hip hop band N.E.R.D. from their debut studio album, In Search Of.... The nu metal song features rappers Vita and Lee Harvey, and was produced by the Neptunes.  The song compares politicians to strippers giving a lap dance for free, due to the use of their excessive propaganda without ever taking action.

It was ranked number 93 on VH1's "100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop".

A remix of "Lapdance" by Trent Reznor appeared on the compilation album Spin This. Although it is censored, an uncensored version of the remix is available on a rare promo single disc. A remix of "Lapdance" by Paul Oakenfold appeared on the soundtrack album Swordfish. 

In 2020, the UK band Wargasm released a cover of the single.
