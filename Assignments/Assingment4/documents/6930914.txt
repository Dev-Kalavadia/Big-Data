==History==
Avegno is first mentioned in 1189 as Vegno.

In the 14th Century, Avegno shared a chaplain with Gordevio.  In 1645, they separated from the mother church in Maggia, and became separate parishes.  The parish church of SS Luca e Abbondio was built in 1313.  In the 17th Century it was expanded and the rich stucco work was added.

Agriculture, formerly the main occupation of the inhabitants, is today almost non-existent.  Handicrafts (making baskets and pottery) and stone cutting were able to slow the exodus somewhat.  The strong population growth in recent decades is due to the proximity to Locarno.  Some companies have settled in the valley and various sports facilities and campsites have been created.  In 1982, the Wakker Prize was awarded to Avegno in recognition of the efforts to preserve the village's historic appearance.

==Geography==
The village is located in the Vallemaggia district.  It is located at the bottom of the valley, on the left side of the Maggia river.  The former municipality consists of three separate village sections, that have grown into a single village.
