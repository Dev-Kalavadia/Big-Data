Title: Neverending Love

"Neverending Love" is a song by Swedish pop music duo Roxette, released on 8 July 1986 by EMI as their debut single. The track was originally written in Swedish by Per Gessle, as "Svarta glas" ("Black Glass"), for recording artist Pernilla Wahlgren, who turned it down. However, she offered the song to her brother Niclas Wahlgren, who recorded his own version. The release of his single was cancelled at the request of EMI, when Gessle recorded an English version of the song with Marie Fredriksson.

The single was originally intended to only be released outside of Sweden, as EMI believed it would interfere with Fredriksson's burgeoning solo career. The label eventually changed their minds, and the single went on to peak at number three on the Swedish Singles Chart. The song was later included on the duo's debut album, Pearls of Passion (1986). Two music videos were created for the song. The first was shot in Luxembourg in 1986 and features a red-haired Fredriksson. The second was directed by Rikard Petrelius and was shot one year later in Sweden.
