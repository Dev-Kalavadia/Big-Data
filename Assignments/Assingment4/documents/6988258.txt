In August 1949, Oakley Court became home to the British film production company Hammer Films. Hammer shot five films there, including The Man in Black and The Lady Craved Excitement, before moving to the adjacent Down Place - what subsequently became Bray Studios - the following year.Kinsey, Wayne (2002).  Hammer Films: The Bray Studio Years, p. 16. While the bulk of Hammer's best known horror movies were filmed at Bray in the late 1950s and early '60s, the studio continued to make occasional use of Oakley Court as an exterior location, for example in The Brides of Dracula (1962), The Reptile (1966), and The Plague of the Zombies (1966). Other films shot there over the years include the William Castle horror-comedy The Old Dark House (1963); Witchcraft (1964); And Now the Screaming Starts! (1973); the cult independent horror film Vampyres (1974); the mystery farce Murder by Death (1976); and the Peter Cook and Dudley Moore comedy, The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978). Freddie Francis was inspired by Oakley Court's exteriors and long wished to set a film there; his Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny, and Girly (1970) was written specially to take advantage of the unique landscaping and architecture. It was used as the location for Dr. Frank N. Furter's castle (called The Frankenstein Place) in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). During filming, actress Susan Sarandon, who played Janet Weiss, came down with pneumonia because neither Oakley Court or Bray Studios had heating or bathrooms, because, at the time, Oakley Court was in horrible condition. In 1995, it was featured as the "Laxton Grange Hotel" in the British television series Pie in the Sky starring Richard Griffiths. On many web resources, it is erroneously credited as being St Trinian's School in the original St Trinian's film series, but a comparison between the films and the actual building show a quite different architecture and overall design: Easneye House in Hertfordshire. Historical notes available from the hotel, however, indicate that some parts of the St Trinian films were filmed in the grounds, for example The Wildcats of St Trinian's (1980).
