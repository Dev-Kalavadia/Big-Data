Title: Ludiano

Ludiano is a former municipality in the district of Blenio in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Since 15 March 2011, it is part of the municipality Serravalle.

==History==
In 1926 a grave was discovered which contained Iron Age grave offerings.  The modern municipality of Ludiano is first mentioned in 1211 as Luguilano. It was mentioned as a local center for surrounding farmhouses and villages in 1351.

The parish church of S. Secondo is first mentioned in 1293.  It was rebuilt in 1779–82, though the older romanesque clock tower was retained.

In the past, the main sources of income were crops, livestock and vineyards.  This income was supplemented by money sent back to the village by emigrants to other European countries.  After the emigration-related decline in the mid-19th century, the number of inhabitants has increased in the last decades of the 20th century and has led to numerous new homes.  In 2000 about half the jobs in the village were in manufacturing, and the services sector accounted for about a fifth of the jobs.  Two-thirds of the working population earned their livelihood outside the community.
