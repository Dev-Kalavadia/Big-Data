Title: Help Yourself (Julian Lennon album)


Help Yourself is the fourth studio album by singer-songwriter Julian Lennon.

==Release==

It was released in August 1991, on Atlantic Records in the US and on Virgin Records in the UK. The album was a commercial success in Europe for Lennon, spawning a UK No. 6 hit "Saltwater" (as well as topping the charts in Australia for four weeks); however, it did not do as well in the US, where Atlantic Records were said to have under-promoted the album.

The album features uncredited guitar contributions from George Harrison (disputed).

The album was reissued, along with The Secret Value of Daydreaming and Mr. Jordan, on 8 September 2009 by Noble Rot Records.
