Title: Clothes Drop

Clothes Drop is the seventh studio album released by Jamaican singer Shaggy. It was released by Geffen Records on September 2, 2005. When the album was released promotionally in 2004, it was debated that the album would not be commercially released. However, over a year later, the album was officially released.

== Critical reception ==

Clothes Drop garnered positive reviews from music critics who praised the diverse avenues of dancehall and pop music the tracks go through. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 7 reviews.

Rob Kenner of Vibe gave praise to Shaggy's dynamic vocal delivery and his taste for old-school dancehall in romantic dance tracks and depth-filled social tunes, saying that "Clothesdrop seamlessly blends Shaggy's sharpest pop sensibilities with his (much slept-on) roughneck pedigree." Rolling Stones Christian Hoard felt the album carried an amalgam of tracks ranging from hip-hop-styled and club-oriented to mind-numbingly generic and a bit preachy, saying that "[T]he entire album has a mixed-bag feel, but "Would You Be" shows that his gift for winsome melody and R&B clarity is mostly intact." Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian said that "Clothes Drop is a typically canny and diverse selection: bona fide dancehall cuts interspersed with hooky pop." Entertainment Weeklys David Browne said that despite tracks like "Repent" that better display his talents, he found Shaggy trying to regain his hit-making glory days with middling results, concluding that "Maybe he should lose the monotonous, low-rent beats and banal-hook girls (and boys)." Writing for Blender, Jon Caramanica heavily criticized Shaggy for attempting to showcase his dancehall credentials with a grating voice and without a featured artist to work lyrics off like Rikrok, saying that "Instead, there’s a Black Eyed Pea (“Shut Up and Dance”), a Pussycat Doll (“Supa Hypnotic”) and the palpable sweat of a man trying to figure out what he’s good at, a decade too late."
