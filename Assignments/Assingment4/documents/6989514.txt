Title: Never Make a Promise


"Never Make A Promise" is a number-one R&B song by group Dru Hill, released in 1997. It is the third single from their eponymous debut album. With a lead by Larry "Jazz" Anthony, the single spent four weeks at number one on the US R&B chart and peaked at number seven on the US pop chart. Although it was a hit, sales of the "Never Make A Promise" single were mainly driven by the popular So So Def Remix of their previous hit "In My Bed" only being available on its B-side.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by Frank Sacramento. The music video features an appearance by actress Michelle Thomas, who plays Jazz's girlfriend. She tells Jazz that she is pregnant and he gets excited; but she also has a drunk father who rapes her but she is too scared to tell anyone.
