==History==
alt=Marinus van Dam (1984)|left|thumb|Marinus van Dam (1984)
In 1944, in Rotterdam, Netherlands, fifteen-year-old Marinus van Dam began work as a janitor at a local confectionery factory, scraping the candy remnants off the floor. Eventually, he was rewarded with an opportunity to attend confectionery school to study the art of candy technology. 

In January 1957, Marinus emigrated from the Netherlands to the United States and found work at a small company in Columbus, Ohio.  After three months, Marinus decided to move to California, where he worked for Herman Goelitz Candy Company.

In 1983, Marinus launched his own candy business, Marich Confectionery, with the help of several partners. The company developed and commercialized chocolate-covered dried fruits. The first was the chocolate covered dried cherry with pastel cherry coating, in the 1980s, followed by the chocolate covered dried blueberry in 1992. 

Today, Marich operates a 90,000 square-foot facility in Hollister, California, with 125 employees in operations, administration, sales, marketing, and finance in offices adjacent to the confectionery production floor.
