There is no reticulated water supply or sewerage system, and residents are dependent on rainwater, bores and septic systems. Many residents commute to work on the Gold Coast or in Brisbane.

The Tamborine Mountain road network enables access to the plateau from four points in the surrounding lowlands, providing alternatives in case of flooding, other natural disasters, or planned maintenance works.

=== Geology ===
The geological origin of the plateau is a lava flow from the Mount Warning volcanic eruption 22 million years ago. Tamborine Mountain rises at the start of the north-east section of the Scenic Rim, the name given to a group of mountains in South East Queensland.

Parts of the plateau and surrounding foothills encompassing the wet subtropical rainforest habitats below the largely cleared plateau summit, and above the surrounding eucalypt forests, have been identified as a  Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.  It includes the southern fragments of the Tamborine National Park.  The IBA supports an isolated northern population of Albert's lyrebirds, as well as pale-yellow robins, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners.  Additional significant birds recorded from the site are glossy black cockatoos, sooty owls, marbled frogmouths and noisy pittas.  Other animals present in the IBA include platypuses, short-beaked echidnas and Richmond birdwings.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Tamborine Mountain.

==History==
thumb|Timber cutting at Tamborine Mountain in 1912
Tamborine Mountain was inhabited by Aboriginal People for tens of thousands of years and, at the time of early European settlement, lay in the territory of the Wangerriburras.  The origin of the name Tamborine comes from the Anglicised version of the Aboriginal word Jambreen from the Yugambeh language. The spelling also appears on early records as Tchambreem and even Goombireen, which means 'wild lime' and refers to the finger lime trees growing on the mountain.

Prior to settlement, the mountain was covered with a diverse range of forest types. Unlike the lower land surrounding the mountain, the thick scrub on the mountain was seen as a barrier to settlement so the mountain was not opened for selection until 1875. However, the selectors were living in the surrounding area and being within  of their selections were exempt from the requirements to live on their selections. Most did not develop the land and sold it once they were granted freehold.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, page 1 In 1878 the first selectors settled on the mountain blocks: John O'Callaghan (deputising for William Walsh) and his nephew, E.H. O'Callaghan. By 1886 most of the mountain had been selected but electoral rolls and church records suggest very few people were living on the mountain.

On 30 January 1893 auctioneers Arthur Martin & Co offered 128 blocks of land, mostly  lots, in the St Bernard Estate, bounded by Alpine Terrace to the north and to the south by Power Parade, St Bernard Street and Siganto Street. The lots were described as suitable for gentlemen's residences with "scenery unsurpassed in Australia" and for the shooter "turkeys, pigeons, wallabies and kangaroos abound".

Tambourine Mountain Provisional School opened in February 1893 in a small cottage provided by William Geissman. On 2 February 1900 it became Tambourine Mountain State School, later adopting the spelling Tamborine Mountain State School.

Much clearing for agriculture took place, though efforts were made to protect the natural values of the area, with Witches Falls National Park (now part of the Tamborine National Park) being declared in 1908, the first in Queensland. The Tamborine National Park is made up of 12 separate sections of land, mainly remnant rainforest, on the plateau and surrounding foothills. A tourist road to the mountain was opened in 1924.

St Bernard State School opened on 27 January 1914.

On 30 May 1926 a United Protestant Church was opened in Eagle Heights Road on land donated by Mrs SA Jenyns. It was built by Mr V Anderson. It was available for use by all Protestant denominations but legally owned by the Presbyterian Church. The church continued to be used in that way until the late 1960s. It was purchased by May and Henry Bishopp in 1982 and donated to the Tamborine Mountain Historical Society, who relocated the church to their Tamborine Mountain Heritage Centre at 53 Wongawallan Road ().1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 2, 5, 9

In 1927 a branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association was established.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, page 7

In 1930 land was purchased at 2–4  Geissmann Street on the corner with Main Street () as a site for a Presbyterian church. A stump capping ceremony was held on 31 January 1931. The Mount Tamborine Presbyterian Church church officially opened on Saturday on 20 June 1931. The total cost of the land and the building was £450.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 8 The manse was located at 29 Griffith Street.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 26 By 1972 the growing congregation was too large for the church and so it was decided to purchase a  nearby site at 34–36 Main Street (). The United Protestant Church was closed in March 1972 and sold for $10,000 to Mr E Tannock to fund the new church with the bell and its tower being removed to incorporate into the new church. The manse in Griffith Street was also sold to raise funds. The new church was consecrated on 3 May 1975 by Reverend Colin Kay.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 53, 55, 84–85 A hall was erected at the rear of the new church in 1980.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 76 The church on Geissmann Street was sold to fund a new manse.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 84 The congregation continued to grow and the church building was extended to double its size and add other amenities. The extended church was officially opened on 14 November 2010.1931–2011 Tamborine Mountain Presbyterian Church, pp 78–79

On 25 September 1990, 11 people were killed and 38 injured when a bus overturned and rolled down a slope on Henri Robert Drive. Most were senior citizens from a social club in Newcastle, New South Wales. A coronial inquest did not support the laying of criminal charges in relation to the incident.

Tamborine Mountain College opened in 1995.

The Tamborine Mountain Campus of Helensvale State High School opened in 1999 with approximately 150 students in Years 8 and 9. It became Tamborine Mountain State High School in January 2001.

In the  Tamborine Mountain had a population of 7,506 people.
