Girl Monstar were an all female Australian rock band which formed 1988 with the line-up of Damian Child on bass guitar; Anne McCue on lead guitar and vocals; Sherry Valier (aka Sherry Rich) on vocals and rhythm guitar (ex-Cactus Fever); and Sue World on drums and vocals (ex-The Wet Ones). Both of their singles, "Surfing on a Wave of Love" / "He's Hell" (1989) and "Joe Cool" (1990), topped the Australian Independent charts. They issued one album, Monstereo Delicio, in July 1992 on Timberyard Records. Child was replaced by Janene Abbott but the group disbanded in 1993. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sound "trash pop style mixed tough guitar riffs with strong harmonies". Valier as Rich, is a country rock artist and has issued solo material as well as performing in bands. McCue is also an alternative country artist, she relocated to Nashville and has released several solo albums.

After a few months Hine left the band to join the newly formed Screaming Tribesmen and was replaced by Sue World (Wet Ones). The group signed with Timberyard Records and in October 1989 issued their debut double-A-sided single, "Surfing on a Wave of Love" / "He's Hell". Both tracks are written by Valier.
