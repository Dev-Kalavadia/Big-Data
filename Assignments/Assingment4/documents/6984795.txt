The In-Kraut, Vol. 2: Hip-Shaking Grooves Made in Germany 1967-1974 is the second volume in the In-Kraut series that was released by Marina Records on compact disc and double vinyl in October 2006.

The album is a collection of obscuro German pop rarities, collected from various soundtracks and singles by artists who never intended to have their music released outside Germany.
