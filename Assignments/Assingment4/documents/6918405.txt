Title: Brian Earnshaw

Brian Earnshaw (26 December 1929 - 15th February, 2014) was a British author,  known for his Dragonfall 5 series, illustrated by Simon Stern.

Earnshaw was born in Wrexham, Wales, and attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read English. He then spent a number of years as a secondary school teacher in different locations in the UK. From 1964 until his retirement we was a lecturer in English Literature at St Paul's College, Cheltenham (a teacher training college with Bristol University qualifications). In 1982 he completed a doctorate at Warwick University with a thesis entitled 'Translations from German and their Reception in Britain 1760-1800'.  After retiring, he moved to Bristol, and worked with Timothy Mowl on a range of books on British architectural and garden history. These sometimes appear with Earnshaw as Mowl's co-author, and sometimes with him in Mowl's acknowledgement as a researcher. He had a great love of botany and travel, and made extensive trips around Europe and elsewhere studying flowers, architecture, gardens and history.
