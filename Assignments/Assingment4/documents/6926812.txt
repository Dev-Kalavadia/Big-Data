Title: Chaba (group) 

 was a folk rock band consisting of three members. They formed in 1996 at the Osaka University of Arts and made their big debut in 2004 and were signed to Ki/oon Records. One of their more distinctive aspects is the incorporation of the traditional Okinawan instrument, the Sanshin, into their music.

Their song Parade was used as the 12th ending theme to the anime series Naruto.

They disbanded on April 7, 2008.
