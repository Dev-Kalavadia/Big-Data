Title: Jaroslav Nešetřil


Jaroslav (Jarik) Nešetřil (; born March 13, 1946, in Brno) is a Czech mathematician, working at Charles University in Prague.  His research areas include combinatorics (structural combinatorics, Ramsey theory), graph theory (coloring problems, sparse structures), algebra (representation of structures, categories, homomorphisms), posets (diagram and dimension problems), computer science (complexity, NP-completeness).

==Education and career==
Nešetřil received his Ph.D. from Charles University in 1973 under the supervision of Aleš Pultr and Gert Sabidussi. He is responsible for more than 300 publications.http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~nesetril/pdf/biblio_published.pdf  Since 2006, he is chairman of the Committee of Mathematics of Czech Republic (the Czech partner of IMU).
