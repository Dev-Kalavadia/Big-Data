Title: Toyah! Toyah! Toyah! All the Hits

Toyah! Toyah! Toyah! is a greatest hits compilation album by the English new wave band Toyah, fronted by Toyah Willcox, released in 1984 by K-tel. The album is also known as Toyah! Toyah! Toyah! All the Hits by including the cover slogan to differentiate it from the earlier live album Toyah! Toyah! Toyah!.

==Background==
It was the band's first compilation album to date and covered material from the Sheep Farming in Barnet era through to 1983's Love Is The Law. It consisted of most of Toyah's singles, including all charting singles, as well as non-single tracks. The rare song "Sphinx" was previously only available as a flexi disc included with issue 8 of Flexipop magazine in 1981. The compilation marked the first time that "Good Morning Universe", "Thunder in the Mountains", "Sphinx" and "Be Proud Be Loud (Be Heard)" were included on a full-length album. The record sleeve was designed by Bill Smith. A companion VHS videocassette was also released containing four music videos and a live performance. The album was a moderate chart success in the UK.
