Title: Space (Ibiza nightclub)



Space (, , ) is a superclub on the island of Ibiza, Spain from 1986 to 2016, owned by STANCA, that reopened in 2022. 

It was awarded "Best Global Club" at the International Dance Music Awards in 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Space was located in Platja d'en Bossa on the outskirts of Ibiza Town, close to the airport. In 2017, Hï Ibiza opened in Space Ibiza's original location. Space Ibiza announced in 2021 that it would reopen its doors in 2022. The club has since reopened at a new location.

== History ==
Space first opened in early summer of 1986. The opening night featured the opening of the water park Aguamar located behind the club, party-goers being able to take advantage of the waterslides at night.

Space in its current form began in 1989 when Pepe Rosello, Ibiza nightclub owner since 1963, took over the establishment, which in the four years since it was built had housed a conference hall with a discothèque. The opening policy agreed with Spanish licensing laws, which state that an establishment must close for at least two hours a day.

Following the closure of three of Ibiza's clubs at the start of the 2007 season, local authorities have hinted at plans to alter the licensing regulations that allow clubs to open for 22 hours per day. Suggestions at present would allow for clubs to open at noon. Clubs may not open before 8 a.m.

Space, DC10 and Bora-Bora in Sant Josep allows after-hours parties.

The first DJs to shape the venue into its current shape were Alex P and Brandon Block, two British club DJs/producers and residents of Sunday Space Terrace — Space's outdoor terrace, where airliners roar overhead. This open terrace and the roaring sound of the airliners breaking through the booming dance music has become one of the club's defining features. Since Amnesia and Privilege have had to encase their open-air dance floors due to noise complaints from their neighbours, Space remains one of the few venues where club-goers can have this experience, and the crowd's greeting of the arriving aircraft has also become a ritual among the club's patrons.

Other resident DJs/producers responsible for the club's popularity include Reche, Jose de Divina, Jon Ulysses and Monkey.

Carl Cox was most associated with the club for nearly 15 years, thanks to his "Music is Revolution" night. When Pepe Rosello stepped down from the club, Cox decided to move on, playing a nine-hour final set in September 2016. Space released compilations every year via the former Azuli label and now with CR2 Records.

===Post closure===
Since the club closed in 2016, it has since been bought by Ushuaïa Entertainment and was reopened in 2017 under the name Hï Ibiza.

Some media reported in April 2022, Elon Musk and the former owner of Space Club signed a contract about a Space Club at SpaceX space station by the year 2030.
