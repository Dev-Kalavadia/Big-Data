==History==
Calpiogna is first mentioned in 1246 as Calpiognia. The village was the seat of the still existing Degagna of Fichengo, one of three Degagne that makes up the Vicinanza (cooperative village) of Faido.  Faido included; Calpiogna, Primadengo, Campello, Fontanedo (abandoned in the 18th century), Chinchengo and a part of the village of Faidos as well as several alpine pastures in Graubünden.  In the Middle Ages the village belonged to the parish of Mairengo.  However, since 1670 it has formed a separate parish, which until 1837 included Campello.  The Chapel of S. Eutichio was first mentioned in 1577.  It was rebuilt in 1665 and consecrated to St. Athanasius.  The chapel of St. Anthony of Padua in Primadengo dates back to 1651.  The village lived on farming and grazing, while periodic and seasonal emigration secured additional income.  In the 19th Century many residents of the village began to emigrate to France, England and the United States.  Emigration increased in the 20th Century.  Since the 1950s the mountain pastures of former Prodo (with Carì) draw numerous winter and summer visitors.
