Title: The New Pollution

"The New Pollution" is a song by American musician Beck, released as the third single from his fifth album, Odelay (1996). It samples the song "Venus" by Joe Thomas. In the US, the song peaked at number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart. In Europe, it was a Top 10 hit in Iceland, peaking at number nine.

==Critical reception==
Justin Chadwick from Albumism picked "The New Pollution" as one of the "unequivocal standouts" of the Odelay album, describing it as "buoyant" and "exhilarating, pop-friendly fare". British magazine Music Week rated the song four out of five, adding, "Similar to Devils Haircut in execution, this mellow outing from Odelay should follow its predecessor into the Top 30." Editor Alan Jones called it a gem, adding, "Like the hit Devils Haircut, it sounds very tongue in cheek and combines the psychedelic swirl of The Beatles' Within You, Without You with the bass line from Taxman, although it doesn't really sound like a Beatles record. It does have their freshness and is very commercial and is sure to score." David Sinclair from The Times viewed it as a "sneaky re-working of that old Taxman riff."Sinclair, David (March 1, 1997). "The week's top pop releases; Records". The Times.
