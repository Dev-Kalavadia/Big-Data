==Walter Duranty investigation==

In 2003, The New York Times commissioned Von Hagen to study Duranty's role in covering up genocide in Ukraine. He reported that "after reading through a good portion of Duranty's reporting for 1931, I was disappointed and disturbed by the overall picture he painted of the Soviet Union for that period...but after reading so much of Duranty in 1931 it is far less surprising to me that he would deny in print the famine of 1932-1933." The results of the study led him to call for Duranty's Pulitzer Prize to be revoked, remarking to the press that "for the sake of The New York Times honor, they should take the prize away.""N.Y. Times urged to rescind 1932 Pulitzer", retrieved February 2, 2008Coulter, Ann H. Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America. New York: Crown Forum, 2011, pages 266-267.  

Asked if his opinion of Duranty's reporting would change if he were to examine only those 13 articles for which Duranty won the Pulitzer Prize, Dr. von Hagen replied with a resolute no. The reporting for which he won the Pulitzer Prize was "quintessential of the problems of Mr. Duranty's analysis," Dr. von Hagen said. The professor said that Duranty's award "diminishes the prize's value."

==Personal life==

Von Hagen married Johnny Roldan-Chacon on October 15, 2013, in California.
