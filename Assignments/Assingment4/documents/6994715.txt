Title: 1034 Mozartia

1034 Mozartia, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 September 1924, by Soviet Vladimir Albitsky at Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula, and named after Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

== Orbit and classification ==

Mozartia orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,268 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation in 1924.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, Mozartia is a common S-type asteroid.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Mozartia measures 7.919 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.250.

=== Lightcurves ===

As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of Mozartia has been obtained. The body's rotation period and shape remain unknown.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the influential Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791). The official  was published by the Minor Planet Center in November 1952 ().
