Title: 76 mm mountain gun M1938

The 76 mm mountain gun M1938 (Russian: 76-мм горная пушка обр. 1938 г.) was a Soviet gun used in World War II.

In 1937, USSR got a license for Skoda 75 mm M1936 mountain gun in exchange for license production of Tupolev SB in Czechoslovakia; subsequently, in 1937-1938 a team led by L. I. Gorlitskiy at Plant no 7 developed a modification eventually adopted as 76 mm mountain gun M1938.

The gun had high elevation angle and could be quickly dismantled for transporting by pack horses. Sprung wheels allowed high towing speed. The gun was light enough to be moved in combat by its crew.

By 1 June 1941, the Red Army possessed about 1068 pieces. In addition to mountain units, the weapon was issued to some airborne units.

In Wehrmacht service the gun was designated as 7.62 cm GebK 307(r). 3.1944 21. 16 on west and 5 on ost.
The Finnish army operated five captured pieces, known as 76 VK 38.
