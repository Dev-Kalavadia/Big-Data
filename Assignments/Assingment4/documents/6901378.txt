Title: Kuidas kuningas kuu peale kippus




Kuidas kuningas Kuu peale kippus (How the King Wanted to Go to the Moon) is an album released in 2004 by No-Big-Silence and Kosmikud.

The singles are "Kuninga imekanad", "Sepa kahurikuul" and "Tisleri kastitorn".

This album is based on the 1976 TV musical Kuidas kuningas kuu peale kippus by Peeter Volkonski and Dagmar Normet. 
Now, 28 years later Kosmikud and No-Big-Silence give the songs new energy. The original arrangement was done by the Estonian rock band Ruja (1971-1988).

==Style==

For many NBS fans this album may seem to sound very strange on first listen. The music can be considered to be a mash of Kosmikud's and No-Big-Silence's music. While "Vapper major annab au", "Sepa kahurikuul" and "Tisleri kastitorn" sound more like standard No-Big-Silence songs, the other tracks can be seen as NBS/Kosmikud mash-ups.
