Title: Larut Wars



The Larut Wars were a series of four wars started in July 1861 and ended with the signing of the Pangkor Treaty of 1874. The conflict was fought among local Chinese secret societies over the control of mining areas in Perak which later involved rivalry between Raja Abdullah and Ngah Ibrahim, making it a war of succession.

== First war (1861–62) ==
The First Larut War began in July 1861 when arguments over control of watercourse to their mines escalated and led members of the Hai San Society to drive the members of the Ghee Hin society out of Klian Baharu (now known as Kamunting).Notes on the Larut Disturbances by Khoo Kay Kim, A history of Perak, Sir Richard Olof Winstedt, Richard James Wilkinson, Sir William Edward Maxwell, republished by Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1974, PPiv&vHistory of Malaya, 1400-1959, Joginder Singh Jessy, Jointly published by the United Publishers and Peninsular Publications, 1963, P151A portrait of Malaysia and Singapore, Soo Hai Ding Eing Tan, Oxford University Press, 1978, , , PP78&123The Malayan tin industry to 1914: with special reference to the states of Perak, Selangor, Negri, Sembilan, and Pahang by Lin Ken Wong, Published for the Association for Asian Studies by the University of Arizona Press, 1965, P27 The Governor of Straits Settlements, William Orfeur Cavenagh intervened and the Mentri of Larut, Ngah Ibrahim, was made to compensate the Ghee Hin with $17,447 on behalf of the Sultan of Perak.A portrait of Malaysia and Singapore, Soo Hai Ding Eing Tan, Oxford University Press, 1978, , , PP79The Western Malay States, 1850-1873: the effects of commercial development on Malay politics, Kay Kim Khoo, Oxford University Press, 1972, P129A history of Malaya, Joseph Kennedy, Macmillan, 1970, P138A short history of Malaya, Gerald Percy Dartford, Longmans, Green, 1963, P128The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The European conquest, D.

== Second war (1865) ==
The Second Larut War took place in 1865 and was sparked off by a gambling quarrel in June of that year between members of the two opposing secret societies. The Hai San members took 14 Ghee Hin as prisoners, 13 of whom were killed. The 14th escaped to inform his clan and the Ghee Hin retaliated by attacking a Hai San village, razing it to the ground and killing 40 men in the process. The battle continued back and forth and spread to Province Wellesley and the island of Penang while other secret societies started to join the fray. Both sides were later exhausted and finally decided to come to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders exiled.History of Malaya, 1400-1959, Joginder Singh Jessy, Jointly published by the United Publishers and Peninsular Publications, 1963, P152Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 64, MBRAS, 1991, P10A portrait of Malaysia and Singapore, Soo Hai Ding Eing Tan, Oxford University Press, 1978, , , P79The impact of Chinese secret societies in Malaya: a historical study, Wilfred Blythe, Royal Institute of International Affairs, Issued under the auspices of the Royal Institute of International Affairs [by] Oxford U.P., 1969, P115

By around 1870, there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other. It is this proximity that might explain how the next battle began.Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 36, Part 2, MBRAS, 1968, P44The dynamics of Chinese dialect groups in early Malaya, Lau-Fong Mak, Singapore Society of Asian Studies, 1995, P72

== Third war (1871–72) ==
The Third Larut War was rumoured to have erupted in 1871 over a scandal - an extra-marital relationship involving the Ghee Hin leader and the wife of a nephew of the Hai San leader, Chung Keng Quee. Upon discovery, the adulterous couple was caught, tortured, put into a pig basket and thrown into a disused mining pond where they drowned. Avenging the death of their leader, Ghee Hin had 4,000 mercenaries imported from mainland China via Penang attack the Hai San and for the first time, the Hai San were driven out of Larut. About 10,000 Hai San men sought refuge in Penang. Months later, the Hai San supported by Ngah Ibrahim recovered their Matang and Larut mines. At this time, Raja Abdullah a claimant to the throne of Perak (in opposition to Sultan Ismail who was installed in Abdullah's absence) after Sultan Ali (r. 1865–1871) died in 1871, and an enemy of Ngah Ibrahim, took sides against the Hai San and Ngah Ibrahim and the wars between the Chinese miners transformed into civil war involving the Malay chiefs of Perak.The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The European conquest, D.

== Fourth war and the Pangkor Treaty (1873–74) ==

The Fourth Larut War occurred in 1873, merely a year after the previous battle. Weeks after Hai Sans regained Larut, Ghee Hin, supported by Raja Abdullah, counter-attacked with arms and men from Singapore and China. Ngah Ibrahim's properties in Matang were destroyed. Local Malay residents were also killed and their property, destroyed. Trouble spread to Krian, Pangkor and Dinding. The quarrelling Malay chiefs who had taken sides in the Larut Wars were now alarmed at the disorder created by the Chinese miners and secret societies. The Straits Settlement Penang Chinese seeing their investments destroyed in the Larut Wars sought intervention from the British. Over 40,000 Chinese from the Go-Kuan and Si-Kuan were engaged in the fratricidal war involving the Perak royal family.Triad and tabut: a survey of the origin and diffusion of Chinese and Mohamedan secret societies in the Malay Peninsula, A.D. 1800-1935, Parts 1800-1935, Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne,  Govt.

The Perak sultanate, involved in a protracted succession struggle, was unable to maintain order.

The need to restore law and order in Perak gave cause for a new British policy concerning intervention in the affairs of the Malay States which resulted in the Pangkor Treaty. In 1874, the Straits Settlements governor Sir Andrew Clarke convened a meeting on Pulau Pangkor, at which Sultan Abdullah was installed on the throne of Perak in preference to his rival, Sultan Ismail.Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei By Simon Richmond, Lonely Planet, 2010, , , P144Triad and tabut: a survey of the origin and diffusion of Chinese and Mohamedan secret societies in the Malay Peninsula, A.D. 1800-1935, Parts 1800-1935, Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne, Govt.

Documents were signed on 20 January 1874 aboard the ship The Pluto at Pangkor Island to settle the Chinese dispute, clear the Sultan succession dispute and pave the way for the acceptance of British Residency - Captain Speedy was appointed to administer Larut as assistant to the British Resident.Nineteenth-century Malaya: the origins of British political control, Charles Donald Cowan, Oxford University Press, 1967, P184Swettenham by Henry Sackville Barlow, Southdene, 1995, P119Footprints in Malaya by Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham, Hutchinson, 1942, P30Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 27, MBRAS, 1 January 1954, P12Imperial Connections: India in the Indian Ocean Arena, 1860-1920 By Thomas R.

Chung Keng Quee and Chin Ah Yam, leaders of the Hai San and Ghee Hin, respectively, were ennobled by the British with the title of Chinese Kapitan and the town of Larut was renamed Taiping ("太平" in Chinese, meaning "everlasting peace") as a confirmation of the new state of truce. Three days later, Chung Keng Quee was appointed a member of the Pacification Commission headed by Captain S. Dunlop and Messrs. Frank Swettenham and William A. Pickering - one of the objectives of the commission was to arrange an amicable settlement of the squabbles over the tin mines at Larut.The Mandarin-Capitalists from Nanyang: Overseas Chinese Enterprise in the Modernisation of China 1893-1911 By Michael R.

Scholar Irene Liao has connected with this settlement the establishment in the 1880s in Taiping of the first temple in the Malay peninsula devoted to goddess He Xiangu (何仙姑). Liao sees the establishment of the temple as an “effort to reconcile” after the wars, and “as part of a cultural strategy to symbolically integrate all Guangdong immigrants into one community.” Many Chinese miners came from Zengcheng District, the main center of the cult of He Xiangu.Irene Liao, “拉律戰爭與何仙姑信仰在英屬馬來亞的開展” (The Larut Wars and the Beginning of the He Xiangu Cult in British Malaya), Bulletin of the Institute of Modern History Academia Sinica 100 (2018), 47–84 (47).

== Aftermath ==

The newly appointed British Resident Minister James W. W. Birch was assassinated in 1875 on the orders of Lela Pandak Lam (alias Dato Maharaja Lela). Lela was a prince and mufti from Upper Perak, who was either motivated to protect his economic interests by restoring slavery – which had been prohibited by the British – or restore independence to Perak – a view commonly held by modern Malaysian nationalists. In the resulting Perak War (1875–76), the British retaliated by defeating the rebels, executing Lela and expelling both Raja Abdullah and Ngah Ibrahim to the Seychelles on the accusation that they had been involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Birch. The British appointed Yusuf Sharifuddin Muzaffar Shah to regent of Perak in 1877, finally appointing him as the new sultan of Perak in 1886.
