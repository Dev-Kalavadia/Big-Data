Title: Coroner (album)


Coroner is the penultimate release by the Swiss thrash metal band Coroner. It is technically a compilation album, although it features new material as well as selected songs from the band's previous albums. It is also regarded as their final album, even though it was succeeded by a final compilation of unreleased material in 1996, titled The Unknown Unreleased Tracks 1985–95. The band chose to go into the studio for the last time, instead of releasing a greatest hits compilation, even though they had disbanded officially in 1994 (on some of the tracks, Edelmann and Broder are replaced by session musicians).
