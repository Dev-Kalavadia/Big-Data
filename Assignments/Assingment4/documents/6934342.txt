The Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) is a  marked canoeing trail in the northeastern United States and Canada, extending from Old Forge in the Adirondacks of New York to Fort Kent, Maine. Along the way, the trail also passes through the states and provinces of Vermont, Quebec, and New Hampshire. The trail was  opened on June 3, 2006.

==Overview==
thumb|250px|Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) sign
The trail has been likened to a water version of the Appalachian Trail, and there are many similarities: both are long-distance trails that most people will use for day trips or short overnight trips. Many of those who paddle the entire trail will do so in sections.  Unlike the AT, the NFCT obtains access for campsites and portages through landowner permission rather than through land protection. Also, many sections of the trail require a high level of skill to complete.

The trail is divided into 13 sections: Adirondack Country (West) New York, Adirondack North Country (Central) New York, Adirondack Country (East) New York, Islands and Farms Region Vermont, Upper Missisquoi Valley Vermont/Quebec, Northeast Kingdom Quebec/Vermont, Great North Woods New Hampshire, Rangeley Lakes Region Maine, Flagstaff Region Maine, Greater Jackman Region Maine, Moosehead/Penobscot Region Maine, Allagash Region (South) Maine, and Allagash Region (North) Maine. Each of these sections has been mapped and documented in order to establish the trail.

Trail towns include Old Forge, Richford, Vermont, The Errol-Berlin Corridor, New Hampshire and Rangeley, Maine. In Maine it primarily traverses through the North Maine Woods region

The trail covers 58 lakes and ponds, 22 rivers and streams, and 63 "carries" (portages) totaling .  On some sections of the trail, portage trails, campsites, and access areas are marked with Northern Forest Canoe Trail medallions,  a yellow diamond with blue lettering.

The American Canoe Association has named the NFCT an ACA-Recommended Water Trail.

==Through-paddlers==
, 95 people have "through-paddled" the trail — traveling the length of the trail in one expedition. In addition, six other "section-paddlers" have completed it in multiple trips.

Nicole Grohoski and Thomas Perkins of Ellsworth, Maine were the first to officially through-paddle the trail in 2006, traveling the length of the trail in about 45 days.  Donnie Mullen paddled the trail in 2000 before its official opening, taking about 55 days but doing so without the signs and maps that were available in 2015.  The fastest thru-paddle was completed in 2012 Elspeth Ronnander, Erik Peih and Emily Johnson. the trip took them 21 days, 3 hours and 45 minutes.
