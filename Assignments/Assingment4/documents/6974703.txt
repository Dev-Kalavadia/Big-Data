Title: San José Las Flores, Chalatenango




San José Las Flores is a municipality and city in Chalatenango Department, El Salvador. It played an important and strategic role during the Salvadoran Civil War.  The town was one of the first settlements to be repopulated by refugees who had been driven away by government bombing during the early 1980s.  In 1986, in defiance of the military, the civilian population returned to reconstruct the village.  This was part of a campaign of a number of towns throughout northern El Salvador, with the assistance of humanitarian groups in North America and Europe, to resist the militarization of the area and prevent continued bombing during the war.  For this reason, a number of U.S. cities became sister cities with Salvadoran towns to demonstrate support for the civilians during the war.  Nearby towns that were also in this movement include Arcatao and Guarjila, which were repopulated in 1987.
