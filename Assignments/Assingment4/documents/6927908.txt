Title: Ceiriog Rural District

Ceiriog was a rural district in the administrative county of Denbighshire from 1935 to 1974. 

The rural district was formed by a County Review Order in 1935 from the merger of Chirk and Llansillin Rural districts. The district was named after the Ceiriog Valley.

The district contained nine civil parishes:
*Chirk
*Glyntraian
*Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog
*Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr
*Llangadwaladr
*Llangedwyn
*Llanrhaeadr ym Mochnant
*Llansantffraid Glynceiriog
*Llansilin 

The rural district was abolished in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, with its area becoming part of the district of Glynd≈µr, one of six districts of Clwyd.
