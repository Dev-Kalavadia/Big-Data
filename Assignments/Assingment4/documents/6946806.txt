==Ulster Flying Club==

It is the home airfield of the Ulster Flying Club. The Ulster Flying Club (UFC) was founded in 1961 and over the subsequent years has grown to become Northern Ireland's largest flying school and one of the largest, non commercial training, flying organizations in Northern Ireland. The club manages the airfield's facilities. The clubhouse is currently open to the public for snacks and for viewing activities at the airfield, as a new clubhouse was opened in 2005 after the destruction of the last clubhouse by a fire in 2004. Many private pilot owners and self-build constructors base their aircraft in the several hangars on the airfield.

The Ulster Flying Club has continued to develop as a centre for private flying and so the ends of existing runways were re-surfaced and the grass strip tarmacked. The Ulster Flying Club has allowed the airfield to be used for various events including air display days and motorsport events.

The Ulster Flying Club provides both leisure flights and flight training for those who wish to pursue a pilot's licence. The club operates a fleet of five fixed wing aircraft. It consists of three C-172 SPs and two C152s.

The UFC operates the G-UFC tail registration with the following:
G-UFCE, G-UFCG, G-UFCI (G1000 glass cockpit)- Cessna 172s.
G-UFCN, G-UFCP – Cessna 152s.

G-UFCO was involved in a fatal crash in April 2018.Two dead in County Antrim light aircraft crash

Recently added new PAPIs on 21/03 and lights on 15/33 have allowed the airfield and UFC to safely carry out night flying and flying in bad visibility.
