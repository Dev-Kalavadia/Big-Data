Title: Right Here (Eddie Money album)
Right Here is the eighth studio album by the American rock musician Eddie Money. It was released in September 1991 by Columbia Records and yielded four singles, three of which would make the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including the song "I'll Get By" which made it to number 21.  The video for "I'll Get By" is dedicated to the producer Bill Graham who had worked with Money on previous projects.

Reaching only number 160 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, Right Here would be Money's final chart appearance with an album of new material, and his singles from the album would mark his final pop chart appearances.
