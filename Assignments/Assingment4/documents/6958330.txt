==History==
Certara is first mentioned in 1264 as Certara with the church of S. Pietro Martire.

Certara was probably originally a simple alpine herding camp for the village of Sonvico.

Rocco in 1670 and also a pastor.

The income of the village came mainly from agriculture and cattle breeding but was supplemented by the money sent back to the village by emigrants.  Starting in the late 19th century, the village population declined as a result of the decline of agriculture and the formation of the Lugano agglomeration.  Today, many houses are used as second or vacation homes.
