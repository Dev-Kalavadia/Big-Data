Title: Galesi-Brescia
Galesi Arms was an Italian gun manufacturer formally named Industria Armi Galesi which was founded in 1910. It was based in Collebeato, on the northern outskirts of Brescia.

==History==
The company was founded by Galesi Giuseppe Nicola, and was initially named Galesi F.lli, (Galesi Brothers), though it later became known as Armi Galesi (AG) or Industria Armi Galesi (IAG). The company manufactured patented automatic pistols, rifles and revolvers, but was most well-known for their small semi-automatics. They began to produce their pistols in 1914, following Italy's entry into World War I. Galesi Arms moved production from Trento to Collebeato, located in Brescia, beginning in the year 1921. In 1924, it had 25 workmen and a hydro-electric machine that had the power of 25 to 30 horses. The majority of their pistols were manufactured from 1960 to 1970, and the company went out of business in 1991, though similar pistols were produced by the company "Rigarmi", which was opened by Guerrino, one of the sons of the company's founder. Rigarmi is still in operation today.http://www.littlegun.info/arme%20italienne/a%20galesi%20503%20504%20gb.htm

==Products==
The first design was a 6.35mm blow-back design based on the Browning 1906. This was the Brevetto 5 (Italian for "Model" or "Patent" number 5). Galesi Arms would continue to do more designs including the Brevetto 9 (a longer version of the Brevetto 5) and the 500 series, which included 14 designs ranging from Brevetto 503 to Brevetto 517. These were various other small, inexpensive semi-auto blowback pistols in calibers varying from .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 LR .25acp and .32 ACP. These show up occasionally in various auction houses and sell for $100–400 depending on condition.
