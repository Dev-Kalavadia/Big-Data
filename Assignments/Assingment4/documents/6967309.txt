He eventually signed with Southend on 3 July 2007 for a fee of £175,000. After winning the club's player of the year award for the 2007–08 season, Bailey was transfer listed on 5 June 2008 after failing to agree to terms over a contract extension. He signed with Charlton Athletic on a three-year contract for a fee that could reach £750,000 in August 2008, seeking championship football and a higher wage, a move that has made him unpopular with Southend fans.

Bailey scored on 21 August 2012, his third goal for Boro, again against Burnley in a 3–2 home win.
