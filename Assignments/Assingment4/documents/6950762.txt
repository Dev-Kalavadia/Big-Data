Title: Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix


The Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix was a motorcycling event that was part of the World Motorcycle Racing season, from 2005 until 2008.

The Chinese grand prix was scheduled to run until 2011, but a low amount of spectator attendance, poor promotion and a lack of commercial interest caused the race to be scrapped from the 2009 calendar onwards.
