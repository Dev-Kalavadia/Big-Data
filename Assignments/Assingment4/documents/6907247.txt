Title: Phnonpenh Model
Phnonpenh MODEL is an electronica band created by Hikaru Kotobuki, a former member of P-Model as somewhat of a joke in order to enter a P-Model cover band contest at a club. They continue to regroup from time to time and have released three studio albums and a live CD from their shows in Paris, Berlin and Tokyo. Key members are Hikaru Kotobuki, Lion Merry (ex-Yapoos and Metrofarce) and Masaaki Taniguchi.
