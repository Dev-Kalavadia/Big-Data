Title: Gustave Strauven



Gustave Strauven (23 June 1878 – 19 March 1919) was a Belgian architect of the Art Nouveau style. He created more than 30 buildings, using new technologies and incorporating wrought iron floral motifs. 

==Biography==
Gustave Strauven was born in Schaerbeek, Brussels, 23 June 1878, the son of Arnold Strauven, a gardener from Limburg, Belgium, and Catherine Backaert. He began his career when he was 18 years old, as an assistant designer working with Victor Horta, helping him with the Hôtel van Eetvelde and the Maison du Peuple/Volkshuis in Brussels. Two years later, he spent one year in Zurich as a draftsman in an architectural office. He then returned to Brussels, where he became a prominent architect in the Art Nouveau movement.

Mobilised during World War I, Strauven died of his injuries on 19 March 1919 in a hospital in Haute-Savoie, France. He was only forty years old. All his work was completed in less than twenty years.

==Saint-Cyr House==


The Saint-Cyr House is Strauven's most important building, built between 1901 and 1903 in a flamboyant Art Nouveau style. It was built to serve as a private residence of the painter George Léonard de Saint-Cyr. The house is situated at 11, / in the Squares Quarter (eastern part of the City of Brussels). It is only  wide, but is given extraordinary height by his elaborate architectural inventions.

The facade is entirely covered by polychrome bricks and has a good deal of wrought iron, which is adorned with geometric motifs and ornate balustrades at each floor. The wrought iron mimics vegetation and the decorative elements occupy all the space available. Due to its extravagance, the building has been called Art Nouveau-Baroque. The interior is characterised by different styles, varying according to the rooms.

The house had been in a poor state of repair, but as of March 2013, has been restored to its former splendour by the Brussels architect Francis Metzger, from the MA² office.
