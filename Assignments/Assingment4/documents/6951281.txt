==History==
San Nazzaro is first mentioned in 1258 as sancto Nazario.

In the hamlet of Vairano, cremation urns have been found which may date back to the Bronze Age cremations.  Additionally, Roman era pottery and coins have also been discovered.  In the hamlet of Mossana, a number of Roman graves were discovered.  In the hamlet of Taverna, there used to stand a tower, which had probably given by Frederick I Barbarossa in 1186 to the Orelli family.  The tower later passed into the possession of the nobility of Locarno and was used in the control of trade in the Upper Lake Maggiore and Gambarogno river areas.  Even in the Middle Ages it was a center place in the Gambarogno valley.  In the 13th century, the Vicinanza meetings were held in the church square in Taverna.  In 1487, the Gambarogno became independent of Locarno, and San Nazzaro became the seat of the Podestà and the court.

It was part of the parish of Vira, until it became an independent parish in 1558.  The parish church of SS Nazzaro e Celso was first mentioned in 1258.  It was rebuilt in 1790 in the classicist style and enlarged.

The population lived, primarily, from agriculture and grazing.  The local economy was supplemented in the 15th century by emigration, mostly of bricklayers and builders, to Italy. In the second half of the 20th century, there was a strong population growth, as the village became home to a few tourist hotels and many second homes.  In 2000, approximately two thirds of the workers in the municipality were commuters.
