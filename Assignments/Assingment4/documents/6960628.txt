Title: Andrew Casson

Andrew John Casson FRS (born 1943) is a mathematician, studying geometric topology. Casson is the Philip Schuyler Beebe Professor of MathematicsAndrew Casson named the Beebe Professor of Mathematics, Yale Daily Bulletin,  June 10, 2011. at Yale University.

==Education and Career==
Casson was educated at Latymer Upper School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA in the Mathematical Tripos in 1965.'University News: Cambridge Tripos Results', Times, 21 June 1965. His doctoral advisor at the University of Liverpool was C. T. C. Wall, but he never completed his doctorate; instead what would have been his Ph.D. thesis became his fellowship dissertation as a research fellow at Trinity College.

Casson was Professor of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin between 1981 and 1986, at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1986 to 2000, and has been at Yale since 2000.

==Work==
Casson has worked in both high-dimensional manifold topology and 3- and 4-dimensional topology,
using both geometric and algebraic techniques. Among other discoveries, he contributed 
to the disproof of the manifold Hauptvermutung, introduced the Casson invariant, a modern invariant for 3-manifolds, and Casson handles, used in Michael Freedman's proof of the 4-dimensional Poincar√© conjecture.

==Awards==
In 1991, he was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry by the American Mathematical Society. In 1998, he was elected to Fellowship of the Royal Society.
