== History ==
Bacchus was invented by Kang Shinho with a strong influence from Lipovitan-D, who was a student of medicine in Germany in the 1950s. He named the product Bacchus after he saw the statue for the Greek god Bacchus inside of the Hamburg City Hall. Bacchus started in 1961 as tablet (박카스-정) before Kang turned it into a drink in 1963.Bacchus, ein Dauer-Verkaufsschlager mit Kultcharakter, Korea.net, November 10, 2014.

Bacchus has been popular in South Korea for many years. Originally, it was sold in pharmacies as an 'herbal medicine' to prevent colds and cure hangovers, rather than as an energy drink. The Bacchus-D and -F formulas are both manufactured and sold in South Korea at this time; neither line has been discontinued. The use of Bacchus-F among university students is highly prevalent.

It has recently risen to prominence in American culture alongside other popular energy drinks consumed in combination with alcohol, such as Vodka-Red Bull. The most common form of consumption is the "Bacchus Bomb", which is produced by pouring a full 3.3 oz bottle of Bacchus into a cup and subsequently dropping a shot glass filled with vodka into the cup, with the resulting mixture being consumed as rapidly as possible.
