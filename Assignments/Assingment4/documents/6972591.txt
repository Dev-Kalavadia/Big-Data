Shirazeh Houshiary (born 15 January 1955) is an Iranian-born English sculptor, installation artist, and painter. She lives and works in London.

==Life and work==
Shirazeh Houshiary was born on 15 January 1955 in Shiraz, Iran. She left her native country of Iran in 1973. Houshiary attended Chelsea School of Art in London, from 1976 to 1979. She was a Cardiff College of Art junior fellow, from 1979 to 1980.

Houshiary was identified with other young sculptors of her generation such as Richard Deacon and Anish Kapoor, but her work was distinct from theirs in the strong Persian influence which it displayed, though sharing with Kapoor a spiritual concern. Her ideology draws on Sufi mystical doctrine and Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, a Persian mystic and poet from the 13th century."Biography" tate.org.uk. Accessed September 13, 2006

She was a nominee for the 1994 Turner Prize. In 2008, the St Martin-in-the-Fields Church in London unveiled a commission by Shirazeh Houshiary and Pip Horne for the East Window.Glancey, Jonathan, The Guardian, 25 April 2008
