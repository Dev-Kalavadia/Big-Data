Lead was formerly obtained from a lead mine just outside the village. A chimney can be seen on the left from the road to Porth Neigwl ("Hell's Mouth"), which marks the entrance to the former lead workings.Atlas of Caernarfonshire; ed. T.M. Basset, B.L.

==Church==
The parish church, which is dedicated to Saint Einion Frenin, was originally established in the late 5th or early 6th century and is one of the oldest churches on the Llŷn Peninsula. In 1537, with the passing of the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act, St Mary's Abbey on Bardsey Island was dissolved and its monastic buildings demolished on the orders of Henry VIII. However, its choir stalls, two Rood screens and bells were saved and relocated to Llanengan Church as it had just been rebuilt in the early 1530s.Bardsey Island Trust : The Island : History Retrieved 16 August 2009
