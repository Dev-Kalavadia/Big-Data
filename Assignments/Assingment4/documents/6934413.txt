Title: Kiss merchandising
The American rock band Kiss has licensed a large amount of merchandising throughout their career.  According to Sandra O'Loughlin in an article for Brandweek magazine, "Kiss has licensed its name to more than 3,000 product categories, from lunch boxes and comic books to credit cards and condoms to become nearly a one-billion-dollar brand."

Kiss have more pieces of merchandise and have generated more money from merchandise, than any other artist in the history of music.http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/news/e3i7fd719683c0f9d85179963060fc59c35  Bassist and co-founder Gene Simmons, who has been the most aggressive and ambitious member of the band in seeking merchandising deals, has voiced disregard for the portions of his fan base who disapprove of such merchandising. In his book Sex Money Kiss, he states: "I think it's cool to see my face on a lunchbox. It's fun. I'm doing this for me. You don't have to buy one."

The list of Kiss-related products is not comprehensive, but this article lists the most notable in terms of success and scope.

===Comic books===


In 1977 Marvel Comics published a magazine-format full-color comic book presenting the band as superheroes. Blood from each band member was drawn by a registered nurse, witnessed by a notary public, and poured into the vats of red ink used for printing the comic at Marvel's Borden Ink plant in Depew, New York. Marvel also published a second Kiss comic magazine in 1978, with much less fanfare. In 1997, Image comics began publishing Todd McFarlane's Kiss: Psycho Circus, a much darker and mystical series than the previous Kiss comics. 31 issues were published between 1997 and 2000. In 2002, Dark Horse comics published a Kiss comic book authored by X-Men writer Joe Casey, which lasted for thirteen issues and ended production in 2004. On January 30, 2007, it was announced that the KISS Comics Group, a joint venture between Platinum Studios and the band, would launch a new comic, "KISS 4K", with an oversized $50 Destroyer Edition, at the Wizard World Los Angeles Convention in March and with an ongoing series to follow in May by writer Ricky Sprague and artist Kevin Crossley. "KISS 4K" ran for six issues and one special edition issue in 2008. In 2011 Kiss teamed up with popular comic series Archie for a four-part series, Archie Meets Kiss. In 2012 IDW publishing signed a deal with the Kiss comics group and have begun printing a new Kiss comic series.

Starting in 1997 and continuing to the present day, McFarlane Toys has manufactured several different series of action figures and figurines, ranging from the exaggeratedly demonic Kiss: Psycho Circus series of figures to the more realistic and representative "Alive!" series, depicting the band performing in their 1975 costumes.
