Title: The Key to Joy Is Disobedience





The Key to Joy Is Disobedience was a box set released by the group Coil. It contains the following releases: Live Four, Live Three, Live Two, Live One, ANS, and Megalithomania!.

==Background==
The set is often incorrectly referred to as "Live Box". Upon its release, the set cost just under $200. Other than CDs, the set contains four art prints, one of which is signed and one of which contains an actual drawing. A list of beast boxes is included as well. A black glass disc and a clear glass disc are also included, supposedly for scrying use. The set is sealed with a sticker that must be broken in order to access its contents.

The box set's title is based on a line from Aleister Crowley's "Hymn to Lucifer": "The Key of Joy is disobedience."

==Edition==
This box set is limited to an edition of 100 normal copies and 23 special copies, which are subtitled "Beast Box". These so-called "beast boxes" each have their own individual titles. The titles are as follows:

*lipstick eyes meat
*arse doctor lense haircut
*spilt guilt
*decadent + symmetrical
*fear of the bee means the honey is for me
*why is a mouse when it spins
*it just is

*sipping birdsong through bedsprings

The "beast boxes" were hand decorated by John Balance as well as a few other known Coil acquaintances.
