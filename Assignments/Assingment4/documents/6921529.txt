==History==
The airfield was created for the French Aeronautique Militaire in early 1916, on military grounds. On 18 April, the "Escadrille américaine" n° 124 was formed under captain Georges Thenault's command, later to become Escadrille "La Fayette".

The Air Service, United States Army first set up a V Corps Infantry Liaison School in mid-1918, for which 99th Aero Squadron flew training missions from 1 July until 7 September 1918, before it joined V Corps Observation Group on Souilly Aerodrome; during its Luxeuil's time, the squadron dispatched its 3rd Flight to French 33rd Corps Aviation, flying from Corcieux airfield 19–24 July, and from Dogneville airfield 27 July - 28 August.

V Corps Observation Group was formed on 1 September 1918 in Luxeuil, but formally organized at Souilly Aerodrome on 7 September. 104th Aero Squadron had been flying from Luxeuil for the American V Corps since 8 August when it joined the newly formed group and followed its HQ to Souilly Aerodrome.Maurer, Maurer (1978), The US Air Service in World War I, The Office of Air Force History, Headquarters USAF Washington

From 19 September 1918, 258th Aero Squadron (VII Corps Observation Group) flew missions from Luxeuil Aerodrome; one Flight moved to Bourguignon airfield, near Sochaux, before the whole squadron moved in on 7 November.

All those units flew tactical reconnaissance missions for the benefit of Army Corps, flying over the battlefield, reporting enemy troop movements as well as taking aerial photography and written observation of the area; artillery adjustments would also be made from the air.

The airfield was also used by the French Aeronautique Militaire as a depot, until late 1919. From then on, it saw almost continuous activity until today, still being one of the main French Air Force airbases.
