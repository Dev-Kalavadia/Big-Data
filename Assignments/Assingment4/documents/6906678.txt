Title: The Way to Your Love

"The Way to Your Love" is the second single from British pop group Hear'Say, the winners of the UK version of Popstars. The song was written and produced by Norwegian production team StarGate and was released as the second and final single from Hear'Say's debut studio album, Popstars (2001), on 25 June 2001.

"The Way to Your Love" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart with first-week sales of 75,514 copies. Despite the success of the group's debut single, "Pure and Simple", "The Way to Your Love" spent only one week at the top of the chart and sold only a tenth of their first record's sales; it was the second-lowest-selling number-one single of 2001 that did not reach number one in 2000.
