===Statement that Israel ‘does not deserve to exist’===
In December 2011, Gendron was criticized for a broadcast of his show Face à Face in which he stated that “Products made in Israel on land stolen from the Palestinians that is walled in, in an apartheid regime where they are cut off, it’s very serious.... And a country like that does not deserve to exist.” The remarks sparked outrage from Jewish groups after a clip of the show was posted on YouTube by HonestReporting Canada, a website that monitors the media for anti-Israel bias. The California-based Simon Wiesenthal Center has since launched a protest against the network demanding Mr. Gendron's show be cancelled. In response, Gendron stated that he was not promoting hate speech against Jews or Israel, but rather taking issue with the country's politics, writing in an email that “I am defending a state with both Palestine and Israel living together, I may be naive, but this is my position. Israel as it is today is not my cup of tea.”Israel ‘does not deserve to exist’: Quebec TV host by Tamsin McMahon, National Post January 5, 2012.
