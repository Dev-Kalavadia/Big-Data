Title: Kodak Picture KioskKodak Picture Kiosk (previously known as Kodak Picture Maker) is a line of self service photo printing kiosks manufactured by the Eastman Kodak company.



The units typically consist of an order station connected to one or more dye-sublimation printer(s) in a single unit. These stations are typically installed in a retail location such as Kodak Express stores, supermarkets and drugstores offering both instant print and behind the counter services. The kiosks allow printing digital photos from digital media (such as a CD or a digital memory card), as well as the ability to scan existing photos and perform simple edits and photo-enhancements via the touch screen interface. Some systems are set up as "order stations" that print to a digital minilab in addition to (or instead of) printing the pictures instantly.

The first Kiosk, named the Kodak Picture Maker was introduced in the late 1990s, followed by second, third (G3) and fourth generation (G4) picture kiosks. The most recent model is the Kodak Picture Kiosk G4XE, introduced in 2009.
