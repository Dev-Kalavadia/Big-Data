The RA Photo Club is located in Ottawa, and is the city's largest photo club, with over 300 members. It meets weekly at its location in the RA Centre from September to May, hosting speakers and monthly competitions. The RA Photo Club has many special interest groups, including Nature, Audio-Visual, Portrait, Figure and Glamour, Digital, Photo Critique and Urban. The club is a member of the Canadian Association for Photographic Art, a national organization promoting and encouraging the photographic arts in Canada.

The club has exhibited at many area venues including the National Press Club (located in the National Press Building), and partners with local charities to provide photographic services.
In 2006, these included the Tulip Festival (Ottawa), Canada Dance Festival, Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, Ottawa Bluesfest, Ottawa Dragon Boat Race Festival and Hope Volleyball. The festival partnerships resulted in several media uses of the photographs, including a spread by the Ottawa Citizen.

Partnering with festivals is now limited to the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival.

== Competitions and Rank ==

Photographic competitions are run throughout the year, approximately monthly. These include an annual regional inter-club competition and the Bruce Wilson Memorial Trophy (which features entries of a set of five related black-and-white prints). Special interest groups run competitions or showcases as well, including the Nature Fall Challenge and the Urban Spring Creative Challenge.

Members acquire rank by consistently succeeding in the club competitions. Ranks range from Junior through Intermediate to Senior to Master. In the entire history of the club, there have only been two members that have attained the rank of Master. Jim Sutton and Yannis Souris.
