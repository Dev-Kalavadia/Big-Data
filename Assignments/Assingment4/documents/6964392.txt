Title: Antarctic Ice Marathon & 100k ultra race


The Antarctic Ice Marathon was established by Richard Donovan and Polar Running Adventures to enable marathon runners to complete a marathon on all seven continents. It also enables athletes to complete the marathon grand slam – a marathon on all seven continents and the North Pole.

Runnings of the Antarctic Ice Marathon and  race have taken place at 80° south just a few hundred miles from the South Pole at the foot of the Ellsworth Mountains. Participants are flown from Punta Arenas, Chile to the race location in the interior of the Antarctic and experience sub-zero temperatures and 24 hours of daylight while there.
