==Marching Highlanders==
The Highland High School marching band was known as The Marching Highlanders. With a rich tradition of excellence, the Highlanders were known throughout the state for their unique uniforms and music. The Highlanders performed in full Scottish regalia, including kilts, plaids, and doublets. The Highlanders also had a bagpipe corps within their ranks, one of only a handful in United States high schools.

As early as 1958, the Marching Highlanders began competing in the annual Indiana State Fair Band Day competition held in Indianapolis. From 1958 through 1975, the Highlanders were a presence and force to be reckoned with, earning the title of State Champion on three occasions. The Highlanders returned to the State Fair in 2004, and repeatedly proved their skills by earning the championship title in 2005, 2007, and 2009. In 2010, after consolidation, the Marching Highlanders performed as the Anderson High School Marching Highlanders and once again received the championship.

In the years not participating in the State Fair, the Highlanders participated in the ISSMA Marching Band State Finals, competing in either Class A or B, depending on enrollment. While never attaining champion status, they were considered one of the premiere bands in the state.
