Title: Sant'Egidio, Rome
Sant'Egidio is a convent church in Trastevere, Rome.  Sant'Egidio (St. Giles) is the patron saint of hermits.

The church was founded in 1630 and was abandoned by the nuns in 1971. In 1973, it was occupied by the Community of Sant'Egidio, which had been founded in 1968, and was still looking for a meeting place of its own. The community, which had not had a name before, then chose to name itself after its church.

Together with the adjacent former Carmelite monastery, the church forms the seat of the Community of Sant'Egidio.

It has been the titular church of Cardinal Matteo Zuppi since 5 October 2019.
