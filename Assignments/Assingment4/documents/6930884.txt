Title: 2006 Kansas City Chiefs season



The 2006 season was the Kansas City Chiefs' 37th in the National Football League (NFL), their 47th overall, their 44th in Kansas City, and their first under head coach Herm Edwards. The team failed to improve on their 10–6 record from 2005 after starting at 0–2 start and ending the year with a 9–7 record.

The team endured many setbacks during the 2006 season, including the loss of starting quarterback Trent Green in the first game, the readjustment of a record-breaking offense, and the death of owner and founder Lamar Hunt on December 13, 2006.  Despite these setbacks, the team gained momentum and finished second in the AFC West with a 4–2 divisional record.

The Chiefs entered Week 17 of the season a long shot to make the playoffs, needing a win and a loss from the Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals, and Tennessee Titans. In an unlikely clinching scenario, the Chiefs defeated the Jaguars 35–30, the Bengals, Titans, and the Broncos lost, allowing the Chiefs to clinch the sixth seed in the 2006–07 playoffs and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2003 season. The Chiefs lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs 8–23 to their playoff rival and eventual Super Bowl champions, the Indianapolis Colts.

===Game summaries===

====Week 1: vs. Cincinnati Bengals====


The Chiefs opened the regular season at home against the Cincinnati Bengals on September 10.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Kansas City time.

The Chiefs' offense began at a slow pace, while their defense initially held the Bengals to a field goal within the first few minutes.  The Bengals began to rip through the Chiefs' defense with the help of Rudi Johnson, who would later go on to rush for 96 yards and a touchdown.

In the third quarter, quarterback Trent Green received a concussion when he slid past the first-down marker and was hit by
Robert Geathers' shoulder.Merrill, Elizabeth. QB's injury caps dark day for shell-shocked Chiefs Kansas City Star, September 11, 2006.   Green laid motionless for eleven minutes until he was taken off the field by a stretcher.  The mood of the game changed instantly when the Chiefs lost their leader, and many fans began to leave Arrowhead Stadium due to heavy rain and the dwindling score.

Back-up quarterback Damon Huard came into the game and completed 12 of 20 passes for 140 yards and a touchdown, and was sacked four times.  Tight end Tony Gonzalez caught his first touchdown pass of the season and helped bring the score to 20–10.  The Bengals left with their first win of the 2006 season as the Chiefs began their season 0–1.

====Week 2: at Denver Broncos====


Heading into their second game of the season and first on the road, the Chiefs looked to backup quarterback Damon Huard to lead their first win of the season.  The game marked the first time the Herman Edwards regime played against the Denver Broncos, as Kansas City had not won in Denver since 2000.  The game was broadcast on CBS at 2:15pm Denver time.

The game was the first time the Chiefs and Broncos played with no touchdowns scored by either team.  The Kansas City defense held the Broncos scoreless in the first half, and to only nine points by the end of the game; the fewest the Chiefs have permitted at Denver since registering a 21–7 win on October 22, 1995.  It also marked the fewest points Denver scored at INVESCO Field since it opened in 2001.Moris, Pete. Chiefs-Broncos Postgame Notes KCChiefs.com, September 18, 2006.  

Punter Dustin Colquitt tied a career-high with six punts and established a career-high with 281 punting yards.

After John Fogerty played at halftime, the Chiefs showed their own explosive firepower.  A big gain by Samie Parker for 31-yards set up another field goal by Lawrence Tynes from 34 yards out.  The Broncos fought back on their next possession.  It appeared the Plummer threw his second interception of the game when Patrick Surtain intercepted a ball intended for Javon Walker, but a penalty on Lenny Walls reversed the call.  The Chiefs led 13–10.

A defensive battle ensued in the fourth quarter, as the Broncos and Chiefs' defense held each other from scoring again.  At the 30-yard line, a pass from Trent Green was intercepted by Darrent Williams, intended for Samie Parker.  The Chiefs regained possession at 8:00 left in the game.  The Chiefs secured the win

Making the night even more festive was an in-house standing-room-only crowd of 80,866, the largest since 1972The crowd of 80,866 at the Thanksgiving game would go on to be the second largest crowd to ever witness a game at Arrowhead Stadium as well as to see their team improve to 7–4.  The largest crowd to see a game in Arrowhead Stadium is 82,094 (vs. Oakland Raiders; November 4, 1972) (the year Arrowhead Stadium opened).

====Week 13: at Cleveland Browns====


On December 3, the Chiefs traveled to Ohio to battle the Cleveland Browns following a 10-day break.  The Chiefs looked to secure a three-game win streak over the Browns, who suffered from a 1–14 home record in December since 1999.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Cleveland time.

On November 28, it was announced that former Chiefs starting running back Priest Holmes would not return for the remainder of the 2006 season, along with Chiefs cornerback William Bartee.  Holmes has not played since October 30, 2005, when he was injured on a hit by Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman in a game at San Diego. The injury left him with head and neck trauma, diagnosed by three spinal specialists.Chiefs RB Holmes won't play in 2006 NFL.com, November 28, 2006.  

Before halftime, the Browns tied the game with another touchdown, 14–14.  Kansas City began the second half and Eddie Kennison racked in 39 yards with a pass from Trent Green.  The Chiefs moved upfield and capped off another offensive drive with a touchdown from Kris Wilson.  The play was challenged by Cleveland, but upheld.  The Chiefs appeared to have sealed the win as they were up 28–14 with twelve minutes left in the game.

Cleveland fought back by finding holes in the Kansas City defense.  A 54-yard pass to Jason Wright set the Browns up for a score.  Steve Heiden caught a 6-yard pass for a touchdown, placing the Browns within a possession, 28–21.  The Browns moved 81 yards in three and half minutes.  Kansas City never found its offensive power again: a failed offensive drive gave the Browns possession again.  With forty seconds remaining in the game, the Chiefs gave up another touchdown: a 3-yard pass to Steve Heiden tied the game.  The Chiefs called a timeout with five seconds remaining but were clearly out of Lawrence Tynes' range for a game-winning field goal.  A short pass to Tony Gonzalez, intending to reach out of bounds to stop the clock, led the game into overtime.

The Chiefs won the toss in overtime but incomplete passes barred them from winning their eighth game of the season.  The game marked the second time this season that the Chiefs could not stop a team in overtime from advancing to the red zone and their second overtime loss from a field goal.

====Week 14: vs. Baltimore Ravens====


On December 10, the Chiefs looked to extend their "December home game winning streak" to 19 games when they took on the Baltimore Ravens.  The Chiefs previously won the past 18 games at home in December, leading back to their loss to the Indianapolis Colts on December 15, 1996.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Kansas City time.  Before the game, there was a moment of silence for ailing Chiefs owner and founder Lamar Hunt, who was still in the hospital seeking cancer treatment.

Throughout the first half, it was a defensive fight with the Ravens getting a 41-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter by kicker Matt Stover.  Within the first half, Trent Green committed three turnoversMerrill, Elizabeth. Loss to Ravens puts a dent in Chiefs' playoff chances Kansas City Star, December 11, 2006.

Chiefs fans began to file out of Arrowhead Stadium, realizing their team lost for the first time in December at home in over a decade.

====Death of Lamar Hunt====

In the late hours of Wednesday, December 13, Chiefs founder and owner Lamar Hunt died due to complications to prostate cancer at the age of 74.Associated Press. Lamar Hunt, Chiefs owner and sports legend, dies at 74 ESPN.com, December 14, 2006.  Hunt had been in the hospital seeking cancer treatment since November 22.

Hunt is survived by wife Norma, children Lamar Jr., Sharron Munson, Clark and Daniel; and 13 grandchildren.  Clark Hunt will oversee the family's sports interests.  On Thursday, December 14, before the Thursday Night Football game on NFL Network between the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks, a moment of silence was held to honor Lamar Hunt.

====Week 15: at San Diego Chargers====


The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs.

The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new "flex scheduling" policy.Teicher, Adam. Chiefs-Chargers flexed to Sunday night game Kansas City Star, December 4, 2006. Flex scheduling set for Weeks 14 and 15 NFL.com, December 4, 2006.  Chiefs, Chargers to play in prime time.  Associated Press, December 4, 2006.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998.Chiefs game at San Diego moved to Sunday night at 7:15 PM (CST) KCChiefs.com, December 4, 2006. 

Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a "finesse team" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30–27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14.

Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had "LH" decals on the backs of their helmets.Associated Press. LT torches Chiefs, breaks single-season scoring mark ESPN.com, December 17, 2006.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night.Teicher, Adam. Chiefs notes: White pants for Lamar Kansas City Star, December 18, 2006.

After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18 yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7–3 at the time.

Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multi-touchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14–3 lead with less than 3 minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs.

Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185 yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.  Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24 yards out.

The game was the Chiefs' third straight loss as they fell to 7–7 and the Chargers' eighth straight win as they improved to 12–2.

====Week 16: at Oakland Raiders====


On December 23, the Chiefs visited the Oakland Raiders for a Saturday night game.  The game was broadcast on the NFL Network and local Oakland and Kansas City television at 5pm Oakland time.  Former Chiefs head coach Dick Vermeil helped announce the game with Bryant Gumbel on NFL Network.  The Chiefs had lost three straight and the Raiders lost seven in a row.  The Raiders themselves had not beat the Chiefs in four years and were looking for their first division win since 2004.

Kansas City managed to hold Oakland throughout the first quarter while Lawrence Tynes managed to get a 29-yard field goal.  Kansas City's Jared Allen recovered a fumble from Oakland's Andrew Walter after Walter was sandwiched by Allen and Kawika Mitchell.  In the third quarter, the Raiders would get yet another field goal as Janikowski got one from 53 yards out.  It would be the final score from Oakland of the night, and the third field goal.  Kansas City looked to extend their lead with a kick from Lawrence Tynes but the kick was missed wide right.  Kansas City still had the lead, 17–6.

The Chiefs became the first team to ever win eight straight against the Raiders.  The Raiders (2–13) have lost eight straight overall and matched the franchise record for losses in a season set when they went 1–13 in 1962—the season before Davis arrived to coach and eventually own the team.Associated Press. Chiefs are first team to win eight straight over Raiders ESPN.com, December 24, 2006.

Larry Johnson has 398 yards rushing in three starts against the Raiders, and his 10 touchdowns in six games are his most against any opponent.  Johnson broke Christian Okoye's club record of 370 carries in a season. Johnson's 31 carries gave him 383.  With the win, Kansas City snapped its three-game skid, improved its record to 8–7, while the Raiders lost their eighth straight game of the season.

====Week 17: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars====


On New Year's Eve 2006, the Chiefs closed out the regular season when they played the Jacksonville Jaguars.  The team looked to restart their "December home game winning streak" during the cold, wintry weather.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Kansas City time.

The game began with Kansas City under enormous doubt to reach the playoffs.  Kansas City would slide into the tournament with a win, and losses by Tennessee, Cincinnati and Denver.  The team started the day with the 10th seed in the AFC playoffs, but ended 2006 with a truly happy new year.  The Chiefs paid tribute to Hunt with a moment of silence before the game and the video boards played tributes before and during the game.Covitz, Randy.

Quarterback Trent Green was hit hard from Clint Ingram, resulting in a slightly sprained ankle.  He sat out the next few drives as back-up quarterback Damon Huard returned to the field with the Kansas City offense to enormous applause.Teicher, Adam. Huard shines again Kansas City Star, January 1, 2007.  Huard threw a deep pass to Eddie Kennison (who miraculously held on to the ball after juggling it) and gained 40-yards.  Huard handed off to Larry Johnson, who ran in for this third touchdown of the game from 12-yards out.  The Chiefs were leading 35–17.  By the end of the third quarter, Chiefs starting quarterback Trent Green was back in the game and threw an interception—a play that was met with jeers for Green and chants for Damon Huard to return.

Within the final five minutes, all of which Kansas City held possession, various penalties were issued against the Chiefs and Jaguars.  The most notable of which came against Jacksonville's defensive tackle John Henderson and Kansas City's guard Brian Waters, both of which were flagged for unnecessary roughness.  Both Henderson and Waters began to brawl against each other.  Kansas City ran out the clock throughout the final two minutes and hung on for their ninth win of the season.

The Chiefs, needing four teams to lose in order to gain the final seed in the playoffs, had their wish come true.  Kansas City clinched the final playoff berth with Denver's loss to San Francisco and fulfilled an almost impossible playoff scenario.Merrill, Elizabeth.

====AFC Wild Card Playoffs: at (3) Indianapolis Colts====


Entering the AFC Wild Card Round as the sixth-seed, the Chiefs began their playoff run in the RCA Dome against the third-seeded Indianapolis Colts.  In the first half, Kansas City trailed early as Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 48-yard and a 19-yard field goal in the first quarter, along with a 50-yard field goal in the second quarter.  Also in the first half, the Chiefs offense was unable to get a single first down.  In the third quarter, Indianapolis continued its domination with a 6-yard TD run by RB Joseph Addai.  Afterwards, Kansas City's offense finally got going by not only getting some first downs, but they also capped off their drive with QB Trent Green completing a 6-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Following the touchdown, the Chiefs got a successful two-point conversion as Green completed the pass to FB Kris Wilson.  However, the Colts continued its domination as in the fourth quarter, Colts QB Peyton Manning helped wrap up the game with a 5-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.

RB Larry Johnson, one of the league's top rushers, was held to just 32 yards on 13 carries, along with 29 receiving yards on 5 receptions, by the Colts defense (which was last in the league against the run).

Unlike the teams' previous meeting in the playoffs which consisted of an offensive shootout, both teams' defenses were the story of the game.  With the loss, Kansas City ended its season with an overall record of 9–8.

===2007 Pro Bowl===

Four Chiefs players were selected to play at the 2007 Pro Bowl, including RB Larry Johnson (2nd selection), TE Tony Gonzalez (8th selection), G Will Shields (12th selection) and G Brian Waters (3rd selection).  Shields will make his 12th straight trip to Honolulu as a Pro Bowl performer, extending his record for the longest streak of Pro Bowl appearances in team history.
