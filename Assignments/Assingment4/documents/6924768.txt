Title: Marshall M. Parks

Marshall Miller Parks (July 6, 1918 – July 25, 2005) was an American ophthalmologist known to many as "the father of pediatric ophthalmology".Joe Holley. "D.C. Physician Illuminated The Ailments of Young Eyes." Washington Post. Sunday, August 21, 2005; Page C11.

==Early life==
Parks was born in Old Mission, Michigan to Ruth E. and Reuben Elvin Parks. In 1939, he earned a BS from Illinois College and in 1943 graduated from the Saint Louis University School of Medicine.   His success in medical school gained him induction into Alpha Omega Alpha Society.  During World War II, Parks served as a medical officer on destroyers in the United States Navy, including the USS Gamble and USS Terror during the battle of Iwo Jima.Fishman, Ron.

==Professional career==
Parks studied under the guidance of Frank D. Costenbader, the first ophthalmologist to dedicate his practice solely to the care of children.Marshall MM. "The History of the Costenbader Society: Costenbader's Challenges." Accessed August 19, 2008.  At Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., now known as the Children's National Medical Center, they began the first ophthalmology fellowship training program of any subspecialty."Marshal M. Parks, M.D." Obituary. Accessed August 19, 2008. This evolved from the rotation of Heed Fellowship ophthalmologists who had trained with Costenbader for many years. The first Children's Hospital of Washington fellow was Leonard Apt in 1959.

Parks' scientific contributions include:
* Elucidation of monofixation syndrome
* Description and refinement of numerous eye muscle surgical techniques, particularly the fornix incision approach to strabismus surgery
* Recognition of the benefits of very early strabismus correction (by age 1 year)
* Innovation in surgical techniques for pediatric cataracts

Dr. Kenneth Wright, a former Parks fellow and current director of Pediatric Ophthalmology Research and Education at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, published a tribute to Dr. Parks in the medical text Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus, calling him “the driving force that has led to the development and maturation of our specialty, pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus.”  

==Family life==
