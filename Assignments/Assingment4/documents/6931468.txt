Title: Ballinderry




Ballinderry () is a small civil and ecclesiastical parish on both sides of the County Londonderry / County Tyrone border in Northern Ireland. It is a rural parish of about 350 houses and lies on the western shores of Lough Neagh.

==Places of interest==
The Ballinderry River flows into Lough Neagh at Ballinderry. The river has formed the border between the two counties of Londonderry and Tyrone since the creation of the former. It is regarded by anglers as one of the best trout rivers in Ulster, and is also good for salmon.  One variety of trout, known as dollaghan, is native to the Lough Neagh area. Canoeing is also popular along the river and canoe steps have been built at several points to aid the sport's participants.

Owing to its location on the shores of Lough Neagh, fishing was historically the primary source of income for many local people.
