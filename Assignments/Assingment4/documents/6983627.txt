Title: Superficial perineal pouch


The superficial perineal pouch (also superficial perineal compartment/space/sac) is a compartment of the perineum.

==Structure==
The superficial perineal pouch is an open compartment, due to the fact that anteriorly, the space communicates freely with the potential space lying between the superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall and the anterior abdominal muscles:
* its inferior border is the fascia of Colles, the deeper membranous layer of the superficial perineal fascia that covers the inferior border of the muscles of the superficial perineal pouch. (The fascia of perineum is a deep fascia that  covers the superficial perineal muscles individually). 
* its superior border is the perineal membrane (inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm).

==Contents==
* Muscles
** Ischiocavernosus muscle
** Bulbospongiosus muscle
** Superficial transverse perineal muscle
* Erectile bodies
** Corpus cavernosum (of penis and of clitoris)
** Corpus spongiosum (of penis)
* Vessels
** Posterior scrotal arteries (males)/Labial arteries (females)
** Artery to bulb (males)/vestibule (females)
** Urethral artery
*Nerves
**Posterior scrotal nerves (males)/Posterior Labial nerves(females)
* Other
** Crura of penis (males) / Crura of clitoris (females)
** Bulb of penis (males) / Bulb of vestibule (females)
** Bartholin's glands (female)
** Spongy urethra contained in the corpus spongiosum
