Title: 2006 Detroit Lions season

The  Detroit Lions season was the franchise's 77th season in the National Football League, and their 83rd as the Detroit Lions.
The season began with the team trying to improve on their 5–11 record in 2005; however, they regressed and finished with a 3–13 record.

The Lions started the 2006 season losing their first five games and six of their first seven. The Lions would not recover, as they never got over .500 during the season. The Lions would only get two wins in their first 15 games, both home wins against the Buffalo Bills and Atlanta Falcons, who both finished with losing records. The Lions went 1–6 against teams that finished with a winning record. From weeks 10 to 16, the Lions embarked on a 7-game losing streak to sit at 2–13, but in week 17, the Lions conclude their season by stunning the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas 39–31 – a loss that cost the Cowboys the NFC East. The lowest point of the season came in their Thanksgiving Day game against the Miami Dolphins. During the game, "Fire Millen" signs, which were a part of the "Fire Millen" movement in association with Lions general manager Matt Millen, were seen in the stands for portions of the game. All the while, fans chanting “Fire Millen” were heard all over the stadium. The Dolphins won the game 27–10.

==Offseason==
On January 19, the Lions hired Rod Marinelli as the team’s new head coach. From the Tony Dungy “coaching tree”, Marinelli had previously served as the defensive line coach and assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The new offensive coordinator, Mike Martz was brought in, and the following were selected in the NFL Draft – linebacker Ernie Sims out of Florida State University and safety Daniel Bullocks out of the University of Nebraska. The rest of their picks included Wisconsin RB Brian Calhoun, Texas OT Jonathan Scott, West Virginia CB Alton McCann, Southern California Guard Fred Matua, and Tulane LB Anthony Cannon.

The Lions played their first road game of the year, as in Week 2, they played an NFC North battle against the Chicago Bears. From the get-go, the Lions trailed, as they allowed 24 first half points. It came in the form of opposing QB Rex Grossman’s 3-yard TD pass to TE John Gilmore and opposing kicker Robbie Gould’s 32-yard field goal in the first quarter. It also came in the form of a 41-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian and a 31-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark. The Lions only score of the game came in the form of QB Jon Kitna getting a 1-yard QB sneak for a TD in the third quarter.

With the loss, the Lions dropped to 0–2.

===Week 3: vs. Green Bay Packers===

In the third quarter, both sides shared a touchdown with each other. Green Bay got a 5-yard TD pass to WR Donald Driver and Detroit got a 5-yard TD run by RB Kevin Jones. In the fourth quarter, the Packers got some distance, as Favre completed a 4-yard TD pass to RB Ahman Green.

The Lions would finally get on the board with kicker Jason Hanson nailing a 32-yard field goal.

===Week 12: vs. Miami Dolphins===

at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan

Trying to snap their two-game losing streak, the Lions went home for their match-up against the Miami Dolphins in the annual Thanksgiving Day game.

===Week 13: at New England Patriots===

at Gillette Stadium, Foxboro, Massachusetts

Trying to snap their three-game losing streak, the Lions flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 13 fight with the New England Patriots.

In the second quarter, the Lions took the lead with QB Jon Kitna completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey, while kicker Jason Hanson got a 29-yard field goal.

===Week 14: vs. Minnesota Vikings===

at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan

Trying to snap a four-game skid, the Lions went home for an NFC North rematch with the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, the Lions trailed as Vikings RB Artose Pinner (a former Lion) got a 3-yard and a 4-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Detroit’s struggles continued as Vikes QB Brad Johnson got a 3-yard TD run, yet the 2-point conversion failed. Afterwards, the Lions finally got on the board with DB Jamar Fletcher returning an interception 88 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 53-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Detroit held Minnesota to a 30-yard field goal by kicker Ryan Longwell, while Hanson kicked a 45-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Pinner wrapped things up for the Vikings with a 1-yard TD run. Even though the Lions would get a touchdown, from QB Jon Kitna’s 23-yard strike to RB Kevin Jones, Detroit was plagued with 6 turnovers. They pulled within 10 in the 4th qtr and had a fourth and goal with less than four minutes to play. Needing two scores, inexplicably the Lions went for a touchdown and failed, thus killing any hope for a last minute victory. With their fifth-straight loss, the Lions fell to 2–11.

===Week 15: at Green Bay Packers===

at Lambeau Field, Green Bay, Wisconsin

Still looking for their first road win of 2006 and trying to break a now five-game losing streak, the Lions went to Wisconsin to take on the Green Bay Packers. After the teams traded first-quarter field goals, the Packers took a 10–3 halftime lead thanks to a 14-yard TD run by Vernand Morency. Detroit closed to within a point with two more Jason Hanson field goals, but the Packers settled matters with another touchdown run by Morency, this one from 21 yards out with less than three minutes remaining. Packers quarterback Brett Favre broke Dan Marino’s career completions record during the contest, but also threw three interceptions. The Lions fell to 2–12 on the season, 0–7 away from Ford Field.

===Week 16: vs. Chicago Bears===

at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan

Trying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Lions returned home for an NFC North rematch the-now 2-time NFC North champion Chicago Bears. In the first quarter, the Bears struck first with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 36-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Lions took the lead with QB Jon Kitna completing a 23-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell. In the second quarter, Chicago bounced back with QB Rex Grossman completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, RB Adrian Peterson got a 2-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Detroit retook the lead with Kitna completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey and a 2-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams. However, in the fourth quarter, the inconsistency that continues to plague the Lions showed as the Bears won with Gould getting a 36-yard field goal, a 39-yard field goal, and a 44-yard field goal and on a dropped pass by Mike Williams in the endzone on the last play of the game. With their seventh-straight loss, the Lions fell to 2–13 as they were swept by their division rivals.

===Week 17: at Dallas Cowboys===

at Texas Stadium, Irving, Texas

Trying to end their season on a high note, the Lions played their last game of the year at Texas Stadium against the Dallas Cowboys, where Detroit won 39–31. Jon Kitna threw four touchdown passes. An impressive last-second comeback drive by the Cowboys saw Dallas QB Tony Romo be denied of what could have been the tying score, as he attempted to scramble into the end zone, but was tackled at the Detroit 2. The Lions finished 3–13 on the season, finishing ahead of only the Oakland Raiders, who finished 2–14, and received the second overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. They later used this pick on Calvin Johnson, Wide Receiver of the Georgia Institute of Technology.
