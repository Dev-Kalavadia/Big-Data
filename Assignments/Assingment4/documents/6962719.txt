In 1956, the National Council for Rural Higher education was set up by the Government of India, which established 14 Rural Institutes all over India from 1956 to 1963 to promote educational development in Agriculture, Engineering, Public Health and Humanities, in rural areas. The Rural Institute, Tavanur, in then Palakkad district was established in 1963.


Shri. K. Kelappan, popularly known as Kerala Gandhi, who had already established a high school, The Sarvodayapuram Post Basic School in Tavanur, had influenced the then Central Government in establishing this prestigious Institute for higher education in this village. Shri. K. Kelappan and the local dignitaries, Shri. T. M. Vasudevan Namboodiri and Shri. K. C. V. Raja identified the suitable 100 Acres of land for this purpose and approached the owners of this land, Vellayil Mana and The Pappinikkavu temple Devaswom to donate this land.

Vilwamangalam Swamiyar, the famous sage and devotee of Sri. Guruvayurappan, donated the required land including the remains of their hereditary home (Illathara) where Vilwamangalam Swamiyar lived and Sri. Vasudevapuram temple, which he built for his mother.
