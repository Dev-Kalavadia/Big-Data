Title: Photograph Smile


Photograph Smile is the fifth studio album by English singer-songwriter Julian Lennon.

==Release==


It was released in May 1998, after a seven-year hiatus following his previous album, Help Yourself. A promotional sampler was released in 1999 in the US containing the tracks: "I Don't Wanna Know", "Day After Day" and "And She Cries".

==Music videos==
The music video of "I Don't Wanna Know" features a parody band of The Beatles called The Butlers. The beginning of the music video has The Butlers (Ken, a parody of John Lennon; Bongo, a parody of Ringo Starr; Daisy, a parody of George Harrison; and Hector, a parody of Paul McCartney) in a concert with many screaming fans. The concert takes place on a stage similar to the arrow stage from The Beatles' appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. There is also a box seat with the Queen in it from the Royal Variety Performance. The first and third segments of the video are filmed in black and white.
