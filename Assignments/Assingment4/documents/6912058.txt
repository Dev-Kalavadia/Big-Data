Title: Anna Madeley




Anna Madeley (born 1 October 1976) is an English actress. She performed for three seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company and has appeared in three off-West End productions. She has starred in productions on each of the main British television channels and has also worked in radio and film. Madeley has appeared as Kate Kendrick in Deadwater Fell and as Audrey Hall in the remake of All Creatures Great and Small.

==Early life and education==
Madeley grew up in London, attending North London Collegiate School. Her speech teacher set her up with some auditions, and she began her career as a child actress at age seven. She then trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama. 

== Career ==
She performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in its 2001–2002 and 2003–2004 seasons. She appeared in The Roman Actor opposite Sir Antony Sher. From 2003 to 2005, she was a regular cast member of ITV's The Royal in which she played Nurse Samantha Beaumont.

In 2005, Madeley appeared in three off-West End productions (Laura Wade's Colder Than Here, as well as The Philanthropist and The Cosmonaut's Last Message..., both at the Donmar Warehouse), and rounded off the year starring as both Aaron and Young Alexander Ashbrook in the original Royal National Theatre production of Helen Edmundson's Coram Boy. In 2006, she starred in two BBC TV films – as the title character in The Secret Life of Mrs Beeton, and in the original drama Aftersun – and the high-profile ITV drama The Outsiders. In early 2007 she was a central character in the first episode of “Lewis”, and she also appeared in Channel 4's Consent, which combined a dramatised vignette about an alleged date rape with a "real life" sequence in which lawyers and a jury made up of members of the public participated in a trial. In February 2007, she played Nina in a production of The Seagull as an understudy when the original actress fell ill. Madeley was the only cast member to reprise her role in Grindley's 2009 Broadway production of The Philanthropist.

In 2010, Madeley appeared in The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister, based on a script by Jane English, and starring Maxine Peake as Anne Lister, a 19th-century industrialist who was Britain's "first modern lesbian" and who kept a detailed journal. The film was shown on the opening night at the Frameline Film Festival at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco in June 2010. In January 2013, Madeley starred in Hammer Films' first live theatre play, a new stage adaptation of The Turn of the Screw. In 2016, she played the role of Clarissa Eden in the Netflix series The Crown. In 2018, she played the role of Marie Stahlbaum, the late mother to the protagonist, Clara, and the queen of the magical land Clara discovers in the fantasy/adventure film The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. In 2020, she played Kate Kendrick in Deadwater Fell and was cast as housekeeper Audrey Hall in the remake of All Creatures Great and Small.
