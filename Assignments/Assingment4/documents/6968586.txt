Title: Jilawatan



Jilawatan (Urdu: جلاوطن, literal English translation: exile) is the debut album by Pakistani rock band, Call. It was released on November 20, 2005 and gained huge popularity. It was the second album produced by the band's guitarist, Xulfi. The album was received with quite a bit of critical acclaim as well, spending over a year on the Vibes Charts.

==Background==
The word Jilawatan means being exiled from one's country, state or mind. The album uses the word jilawatan in the context of being exiled from one's own mind. Xulfi said to MTV Moto:

The majority of the album is pretty heavy and features the drop-d tuning on guitar. The only exceptions to this are Sab Bhula Kai, Nishaan and Bichar Kai Bhee. Sab Bhula Kai and Bichar Kai Bhee feature guitars with the DADGAD (low to high) tuning whilst Nishaan's guitars feature the traditional EADGBE tuning. Almost all the tracks on the album have acoustic guitars except Shayad, Kuch Naheen, Jilawatan and Wujud and all of the tracks, with the exception of Pukaar and Jilawatan, feature guitar solos.

During live performances, the band plays several songs differently from the album. They usually include an unplugged version of Shayad, include a solo in Jilawatan, perform a completely different solo on Sab Bhula Kai and play the piano intro of Kismet a bit differently on guitars.

==Track listing==
All songs composed & arranged by Zulfiqar J. Khan and Junaid Khan, except for Shayad & Bichar Kai Bhee music by Zulfiqar J. Khan and Jilawatan, Sab Bhula Kai & Wujud music by Sultan Raja, Zulfiqar J. Khan and Junaid Khan.
