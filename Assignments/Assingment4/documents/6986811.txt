==History==
The history of Easts Rugby Union Club began in 1947 with the formation of a team of past students from Brisbane State High School. The club assumed the name Eastern Districts at the suggestion of the QRU in 1949. Easts Rugby Union was incorporated as a not-for-profit association in the early 2010s.

Easts played in lower grade competitions in Brisbane before being promoted to first grade in 1950. The club's first Premiership came in 1997, 50 years after the club's founding. Easts also won the Australian Club Championship in 2009 and 2021.
