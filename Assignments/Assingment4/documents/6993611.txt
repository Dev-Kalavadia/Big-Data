Born in Blythswood, Scotland, Crawford began his career at Arthurlie in Scottish Division Two before being signed by Liverpool manager Tom Watson in January 1909. He made his debut in a Football League First Division game at Anfield on the 13 February 1909, a game that saw the Reds beat Leicester Fosse 4–1.
