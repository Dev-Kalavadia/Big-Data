Title: Prix Jean Romanet


|}
























The Prix Jean Romanet is a Group 1 flat horse race in France open to thoroughbred fillies and mares aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 2,000 metres (about 1¼ miles) at Deauville in August.

==History==
The event is named in memory of Jean Romanet (1914–2003), a prominent figure in French racing. He devoted much of his life to the Société d'Encouragement, and served as general manager of the organisation from 1961 to 1986.

The Prix Jean Romanet was established in 2004, and it initially held Group 2 status. It was one of several new races designed to keep more fillies from being exported or prematurely retired to stud.

The race was promoted to Group 1 level in 2009.
