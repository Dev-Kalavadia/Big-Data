Dene Dháh (/'dɛnɛ ðɑh/) translates to 'Dene language' is the preferred name for the language spoken by the Dene Thá, but linguists and anthropologists commonly refer to the language simply as a dialect of South Slavey. It has been called Slavey, South Slavey, Alberta Slavey, and Dene, a  catch-all term which encompasses several Northern Athabaskan language groups.Moore, Patrick and Angela Wheelock. 1990.

Dene Dháh, the only variety of South Slavey spoken in Alberta (Dene Zhatié is spoken in the Northwest Territories), belongs to the Northern Athabaskan subgrouping of the Athabaskan language family. It is closely related to languages such as Dane-Zaa, Kaska, Dëne Sųłiné, and Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì.Simons, Gary F. and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). (2017). Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition.

=== Dialects ===
Dene Dháh has three distinct dialects: 
* Xewónst’e (Fort Vermilion-Eleske)
* Xewónht’e (Assumption-Habay)
* Kegúnht’u (Bistcho Lake)
Each dialect name translates to "It's like that" and exhibits variation typical of the dialects.

=== Linguistic vitality ===
Most Dene Dháa adults speak Dene Dháh as their first language, and the language is still being passed on to children. In 2006, a survey conducted among school-aged children in Chateh reported a native-speaker proficiency rate of 65%.
