Regolo Ricci (born 1955) is a Canadian artist working mainly in oils and watercolors. He was born in Italy and came to Canada as a young child. He is best known for his work as a children's book illustrator, and he was nominated for the Canada Council for the Arts Governor General's Award for Children's Book Illustration in 2000.

Ricci and the writer Michael Bedard created picture book editions of literary fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen, namely "The Nightingale" and "The Tinder Box" (1835 and 1843, Danish language).

The Market Wedding (2000), written by Cary Fagan, is "based on an old Yiddish tale". It was a runner-up for the Sydney Taylor Book Award and Ricci was one of five nominees for the Governor General's Award in children's literature illustration that year.
