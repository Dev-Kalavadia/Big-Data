Title: Deep perineal pouch

The deep perineal pouch (also deep perineal space) is the anatomic space enclosed in part by the perineum, and located superior to the perineal membrane.

==Structure==
The deep perineal pouch is bordered inferiorly by the perineal membrane, also known as the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.  It is bordered superiorly by the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.Netter, F., Atlas of Human Anatomy.4th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, 2006. The deep pouch is now described as the region between the perineal membrane and the pelvic diaphragm.Netter, F., Atlas of Human Anatomy.5th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia, 2010.

==Contents==
The deep perineal pouch contains:
* muscles
**Deep transverse perineal muscles
**External sphincter muscle of male urethra
**External sphincter muscle of female urethra
**Compressor urethrae muscle in the female is sometimes includedEssential Clinical Anatomy – 4th Edition. p.255
**Urethrovaginal sphincter in the female is sometimes included
* other
** Membranous urethra in the male; proximal portion of urethra in the female
** Bulbourethral gland (males). The Bartholin gland, the female counterpart is in the superficial perineal pouch
** Vagina (females)

=="Urogenital diaphragm"==
Older texts have asserted the existence of a "urogenital diaphragm", which was described as a layer of the pelvis that separates the deep perineal sac from the upper pelvis. The deep perineal pouch lies between the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm and superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.
