Title: Imperial Dynasty (restaurant)


The Imperial Dynasty restaurant was a gourmet restaurant in Hanford, California. The restaurant was founded in 1883 in Hanford's Chinatown, and was run by the same family for four generations, having started as a simple noodle house in the 19th century.

Richard Wing combined French and Chinese cooking in the 1960s to create one of the first fusion cuisines. The restaurant closed in early 2006 due to the declining health of the owner, who died in 2010 at the age of 89.Hanford Sentinel, October 9, 2010
