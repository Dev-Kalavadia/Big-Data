Between 1959 and 1962, the airport was under reconstruction, and three hotel buildings, cargo and fuel storage facilities, a 100-seat dining hall and a garage were built. A new runway was built, as well as radio approach equipment for landing under heavy weather conditions and new radar facilities. The new runway was then capable of receiving Tupolev Tu-124, Antonov An-10 and Ilyushin Il-18 aircraft.

In 1964, a new terminal for 400 passengers per hour was built and put in operation.

In 2007, the reconstructed terminal of the airport entered into operation. The area of the air terminal has more than doubled. Many departments are located there. There have been mounted four telescopic ramps, four elevators and three escalators. It can serve 600 passengers per hour.
