With his original band Gorky, De Vos ended third in Humo's Rock Rally in 1990. Together with Noordkaap, who won the same Rock Rally, he brought the genre of Dutch language rock music to the people's attention. After Gorky disbanded in 1993, Luc De Vos continued under the name Gorki. Stijn Meuris described the genre of Gorki's songs and De Vos's lyrics as "Flemish poetry with the boots in the clay" and "I have no clue what this guy was talking about, but I understood him".
Temporary side projects of De Vos include English language rock formation Automatic Buffalo which he started with the members of Ashbury Faith, and a solo tour in 2010.

With his bands Gorky/Gorki, he had 3 singles and 12 albums in the Flemish charts (the album charts only start in 1995, i.e. after his first albums were released). This included 5 top ten albums.
