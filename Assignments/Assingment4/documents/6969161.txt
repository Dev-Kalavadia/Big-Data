Title: Shasta High School

Shasta High School is an American public high school located in Redding, California. With an enrollment of over 1600 students, it is the largest high school in Shasta County, California. It has been recognized as a California Distinguished School three times and has earned a six-year Western Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation. Its main rival is Enterprise High School.

==History==
In 1899, Shasta County High School opened as a public school to serve the town of Redding, California. The inaugural class had only 70 students, 3 teachers, and a very small number of graduates. The courses were college preparatory and in addition vocational classes, such as bookkeeping and shorthand, were taught. The initial school was located in the residence of Judge Bell but in 1903, a  two-story brick building was built for the 1904-1905 school year. After a countywide election in 1915, Shasta Union High School District was created and the school was renamed Shasta High School.

By 1926, the student enrollment number had grown to over 450, and need for a new campus became clear, as the school building had been built for 250 students. In March, 1926 a location was picked at the corner of Magnolia and Eureka streets. By October 1927, students were able to move into the new school. In 1950, Shasta Junior College was built on land west of the Shasta High School and remained there until a new college was built in east Redding in 1967. Shasta High moved one last time into the vacated Shasta College facilities which is its location today. The old Shasta High Building became Nova High, which housed all 9th graders in the district. After 9th grade, the students moved on to either Shasta High, Central Valley High, or Enterprise High for 10-12.

In 1991, Nova High was closed and 9th graders moved back into Shasta High and the other high schools. The old building would later become Shasta Learning Center, home to the district offices and to University Preparatory School.

=== River Bowl ===

Shasta High School’s main rival is Enterprise High School (Redding, California). The Rivalry of Enterprise High and Shasta High started back in the 1950s, when both schools would steal the other's "prized" possession. For Shasta High School it was the Shasta High Bell. 
The annual football game between the two rivals would later be called the Riverbowl. 
The tradition began in 1993, with Enterprise dominating the first 11 years. In 2004, Shasta won the Riverbowl and again in 2005 and 2007, but lost in 2008. Enterprise won again in 2009.
The 2010 Riverbowl was won by Shasta with a score of 53-20. That year’s Varsity kicker was Ellie Oliver, possibly the only girl football player in the north state at that time.  She was taught the game of football by Bryson Williams.
