During construction of the Gotthard railway in the 19th century, traces of a Bronze Age settlement were found. An Imperial charter from 978 mentions a cortis Crissianicum owned by the monastery of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia. Like the neighboring communities, Cresciano was owned by the Cathedral of Milan. In the 14th century it was placed, together with Osogna and Claro, under the jurisdiction of a representative of the Visconti. In the 15th century, Milan granted the village the right to choose a community leader.

The parish church of San Vincenzo was first used in the 13th century.

Starting around 1880, granite quarries opened in the valley. These played an important role in the economy of Cresciano and its neighboring towns.
