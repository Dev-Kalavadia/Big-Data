The pre-industrial economy was based on agriculture and emigration.  In the 18th and 19th Centuries, the Battaglini family played an important role throughout the valley.  Cagiallo supports the tourist facilities and hotels of the village of Tesserete, and has become a suburb of it in recent years.

===Sala Capriasca===
Sala Capriasca was originally a Lombard walled village.  In the 15th century, it formed a Vicinanza with Bigorio.  In the first half of the 16th century, had rights to the commons in the parish of Capriasca.  It was part of the Tesserete parish until 1933.

Economically the village was dominated by agriculture and rural handicrafts.  The traditional seasonal migration brought extra income.  In the second half of the 20th century, it developed into a bedroom community.  In 2000, four-fifths of the working population were commuters, especially to Lugano.

===Lopagno===
Lopagno, together with Cagiallo and Campestro, formed a Vicinanza since the Middle Ages.  In the 16th and 17th Centuries there were several large-scale emigrations from the village.  The economy of the village was based on agriculture, trade and construction activities.  The inhabitants of Lopagno were among the leaders of the popular uprising against the authorities of the Helvetic Republic on 26 January 1802.  Since 1952, the Institute Don Orione for the care of the mentally disabled, is active in Lopagno.

The S. Apollonia chapel dates back to the 16th century and is a dependent of the parish of Tesserete.

In 2000 about three-quarters of the working population worked outside the village.

===Roveredo===
Roveredo belonged to the Pieve of Capriasca and the parish church of Tesserete.  The local Chapel of St. Bernard of Clairvaux was built in 1403.

Agriculture and pastoralism were once the main sources of income.  Starting in the 1960s, Roveredo developed into a residential community, due to its proximity to Lugano and Tesserete.  In 2000, approximately four-fifths of the workforce in Roveredo commutes.
