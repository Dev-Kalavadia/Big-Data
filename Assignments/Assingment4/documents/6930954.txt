Title: Lavizzara
Lavizzara is a municipality in the district of Vallemaggia in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

The municipality was created in 2004 by a merger of Broglio, Brontallo, Fusio, Menzonio, Peccia and Prato-Sornico.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office  accessed 14 January 2010

==History==
Broglio is first mentioned in 1361 as Brono.  Brontallo is first mentioned in 1574 as Bruntalo.  Fusio is first mentioned in 1258 as Fuxio.  Menzonio is first mentioned in 1364 as Menzone.  Peccia is first mentioned in 1374 as Petia.  Prato and Sornico were first mentioned in 1374.

===Broglio===
The existing village area has developed in several stages.  It was created in 1374, when the valley (comunità) Lavizzara broke up and divided its lands.  At the end of the 16th century, it grew again through a series of agreements between the neighboring communities.

The Church of S. Maria Lauretana was dedicated in 1487.  In the following centuries, it was repeatedly rebuilt and restored.  It belonged to the Sornico parish until 1616, when it became an independent parish.  The historically significant building, Casa Pometta, is from the 17th century.

The highest population in the village was during the 17th century.  The slow population decline intensified in the late 19th century with emigration to the cities and to other countries.  In 1990, agriculture and livestock, which for centuries were the main sources of income, employed about a third of the workforce.  In recent decades, the number of vacation homes has increased markedly.

===Brontallo===

Until the beginning of the 15th century, it formed a community with Menzonio and together with Bignasco and Cavergno it formed a Vicinanza.

The Church of S. Maria e S. Giorgio was first mentioned in the 15th century.  In the 16th century it was rebuilt, and then renovated several times thereafter.  Until 1513 it, along with Menzonio, was part of the parish of Cevio.  In 1513 Menzonio broke away from Cevio, but Brontallo remained part of the parish until 1655.

The greatest population was during the 17th century.  The population decline began in the 18th century, but accelerated into the 20th century.  The road running from the village into the Val Lavizzara was completed in 1955.  In 1990 less than a third of the workforce was employed in agriculture.  Many of the homes in the village are now vacation homes.

===Fusio===

The population reached its peak in the 16th–17th century (400–500 inhabitants), but towards the end of the 18th century began a slow decline.  This slow decline accelerated dramatically after 1950 because of emigration to the cities.  Most of the remaining population is elderly.

The church, consecrated in 1455 to the Beata Vergine Assunta, was a Chapel of ease of Sornico until the 16th century.  It was later rebuilt several times, mainly in the 17th century.

The local economy relied on livestock, pastures and forestry.  The village possessed vast pastures and alpine pastures, which explains the relatively small number of emigrants overseas.  Until the second half of the 19th century, there were two mines in the village that produced steatite (soapstone).  Through the construction of the dam in the Sambuco valley (1950–56) the amount of agricultural land has been reduced.  From the 1980s a number of houses and an inn were built.

The hamlet of Mogno was also part of the village.  In the 17th century it possessed 50 taxable fireplaces.  By 1801, the population had dropped to just 40 inhabitants.  Today it is no longer inhabited all year round and serves only as a holiday village.  Before Mogno was incorporated in 1936 into Fusio it was part of Peccia, and the land around the settlement was shared between Fusio, Peccia, Prato and Sornica.

The church of San Giovanni Battista Decollato was built in 1626 and was initially a chapel of ease of the parish of Peccia.  Towards the end of the 17th century, it became an independent parish church.  In 1940 it became part of the parish of Fusio.  The church was destroyed in 1986 by an avalanche.  The new building, by Mario Botta, was built in 1997 after 10 years of planning and construction work.  The unique construction of the building has already become a point of interest and a source of critical debate.

===Menzonio===
Until the beginning of the 15th century, Menzonio and Brontallo formed a single municipality, and together with Bignasco and Cavergno it formed a Vicinanza which was under the jurisdiction of the Lavizzara valley.  At the time of the Swiss Confederation rule over Ticino, Menzonio was one of seven villages in the valley.

The village church was part of the parish of Cevio until 1513 when it split away to form a parish with Brontallo.  In 1655, this parish was dissolved and Menzonio formed its own parish.  The Church of SS Giacomo e Filippo was first mentioned in the 15th century.  The current building was built in 1585 and was rebuilt in 1644 and finally in 1905.

In the 17th century, the population reached its peak and then decreased gradually, initially because of emigration to Italy.  Later the residents emigrated to California and finally they moved away from the villages to the cities of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland.

For centuries the local economy was dominated by grazing and agriculture.  In the 19th century there was a soapstone quarry and four mills.  The road that connects Menzonio with the valley floor, was built in 1949. In 2000, three-quarters of the workforce were commuters.

===Peccia===
thumb|Peccia valley
Peccia, together with Broglio, Fusio, Prato and Sornico were part of the comunità or valley community of Lavizzara until 1374.  When the valley community broke up into separate villages, Peccia was the largest in the Lavizzara region.  It included the settlement of Mogno and the Valle di Peccia, which was independent until 1669.  The common, shared land of the four communities of Fusio, Peccia, Prato and Sornico (known as the comunella dei quattro comuni) remained shared until 1929.

The village was part of the parish of Sornico until 1613, after which the church of S. Antonio Abate in Peccia was elevated to become a parish church.  The church was built in the 16th century.  After the floods of 1834 and 1868, which destroyed some of the village, the church was totally rebuilt.  The valley church of S. Carlo was built in 1617, and was raised to be the parish church in 1669.

At the beginning of the 20th century, most of the jobs in the village were in the extraction, processing (vessels and stone ovens) and trade in soapstone.  Since 1946, white marble is also mined, which is the only marble quarry in Switzerland.  In 1984, the presence of marble led to the creation of a sculpting school.  This marble was used when the church of Mogno (a hamlet of Fusio) was rebuilt by Mario Botta, after the old church was destroyed by an avalanche in 1986.

At the beginning of the 21st century, manufacturing provides more than a third of the jobs in village.  In 1950-56 largest hydroelectric power plants in Switzerland was built in the Valle di Peccia.  It is fed by water from the catchment area of the Maggia river.  In the last decades of the 20th century, the village invested in its tourist infrastructure.

===Prato-Sornico===
Prato and Sornico, along with Broglio, Fusio and Peccia, formed the valley community of Lavizzara.  In 1374, the community dissolved and the villages of Prato and Sornico became independent.   The common, shared land of the four communities of Fusio, Peccia, Prato and Sornico (known as the comunella dei quattro comuni) remained shared until 1929.  In the 15th century, the hamlet was the seat of the General Council of the valley, then the seat of the Swiss Confederation governor between 1513 and 1798.  After 1803 it was the capital of the sub-district of Lavizzara.  Even today stately houses in the village testify of its political and religious importance of the village.  One of the houses in the village, which was built in the 15th century, extended in the 16th century and renovated in 1975–77, served as the seat of the bailiff and a prison.  Another house, in Prato, is Casa Berna, which is from the 18th century.  It contains the rich library of Giulio Giovanni Gerolamo Berna, the archpriest of Locarno.

The church of San Martino in Sornico is first mentioned in the 14th century, but probably dates back to the 11th century.  It was the mother church in the 16th century of the Val Lavizzara and in 1747 became a provost's church.  The parish church of SS Fabiano e Sebastiano in Prato was built in 1487, rebuilt in 1730 and re-consecrated in 1761 by the Bishop of Como.

In the 19th and 20th century, the emigration overseas and into the cities led to a sharp population decline.  In this alpine village at the beginning of the 21st century, one-third of the workforce still works in agriculture.  In the last decades of the 20th century, many vacation homes and tourist infrastructure were built in the village.
