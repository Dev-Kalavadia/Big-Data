==Music video==


The music video for the song debuted on March 4, 2006 on MTV Latin America in Mexico and South America. It was shot by Rodrigo Guardiola.

The video starts with the vocalist of Panda, José Madero, who arrives to his girlfriend's house (played by Mariana Quintanilla). She is carried by him throughout the video because she is appeared to be dead. Once inside the house, they have a dinner (during which he proposes to her) with her parents, who don't seem to notice she is dead. The parents also act like zombies maybe ignoring the reality of the situation. 

In reality, Mariana Quintanilla (the actress in the video) is the ex-girlfriend of the bassist, Ricardo Treviño.

The video was shot in an old and dirty house in Monterrey, Mexico.
