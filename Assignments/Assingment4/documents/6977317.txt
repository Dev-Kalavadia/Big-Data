Title: African Litany



African Litany is the second studio album from South African band Juluka, released in 1981.
 It features lyrics sung in English and Zulu.

The first track, Impi, which became one of the band's hits, retells the story of the Battle of Isandlwana, won by the Zulu, and was banned from the radio in South Africa at the time, but gained underground popularity. It remains a cult classic in South Africa and has now become mainstream to the point of often been associated with international sports events, in particular rugby.
