Title: Of Long Duration Anguish



Of Long Duration Anguish is the second album by Estonian death metal band Aggressor. This was the last album the band did under the name Aggressor before being renamed to "No-Big-Silence" in 1996.

In 1993 their second album "Of Long Duration Anguish" was released as MC and in 1994 as CD. Korrozia Metalla cover "Russian Vodka" on that album was sung by bassist Cram which resulted in the idea of changing their style. In 1995 Aggressor performed at the biggest rock-festival in Estonia, "Rock Summer '95". After that they went into studio (still as Aggressor) where they were suggested a name-change. So in 1996 they wrote lyrics to a song titled "No-Big-Silence 99" (a street in the U.S. where a massmurder was committed). So the album was titled "99" and the band was renamed to "No-Big-Silence".
