==Background==
The team was born out of a split of LoGaMo Racing, owned by Tony Longhurst, Frank Gardner and Terry Morris. After the 1994 Australian Touring Car season, Longhurst wished to continue in the Australian Touring Car Championship while Gardner and Morris wanted to stick with the Australian Super Touring Championship. At the end of 1994, Gardner and Morris bought Longhurst out, with the latter forming Longhurst Racing to race a Ford Falcon EF in the 1995 Australian Touring Car Championship.

==History==
===Super Touring===
In the LoGaMo days, the team had a long association with tobacco sponsorship. After 1994, this was not able to be renewed due to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and the Benson & Hedges sponsorship concluded at the end of 1994. For the next three years, the team competed in the Australian Super Touring Championship with Geoff Brabham and Paul Morris driving BMW 320is. Morris won the series in 1995 and 1997, while Brabham teamed with brother David to win the 1997 Bathurst 1000, after the Morris and Craig Baird entry had been disqualified. A third car was entered at some events in 1995 and 1996 for Charlie O'Brien and in 1997 for Baird.

At the end of 1997, BMW withdrew their support and the team closed. Gardner retired and sold the Performance Driving Centre in Norwell to Morris. After racing for PacWest Racing in the Indy Lights Championship in 1998, Morris reformed the team with Tim Neff, racing a BMW 320i to victory in the 1999 Australian Super Touring Championship, which he repeated in 2000.

===V8 Supercars===
====Single-car origins====
Morris entered the V8 Supercar series in 2000 with an ex-Holden Racing Team Commodore VS. The car was destroyed at the Oran Park round in 2000 when Morris was involved in a fiery crash with Mark Larkham at the start of one of the races. Later in the year the team upgraded to a Commodore VT purchased from James Rosenberg Racing.REC sale the end of an era for Paul Morris Speedcafe 4 December 2013

In 2001, the team completed its first in-house built Commodore VX, not before winning the Calder Park round in the older VT model. It proved to be the only race and round victories for the team. The team generally raced one car until 2005, when it began preparing the Team Kiwi Racing car under a customer deal.

====Expansion to two cars====
In 2006, after purchasing a Level 1 licence from Tony Longhurst, it expanded to two cars with Fabian Coulthard, Alan Gurr, Steven Ellery, Jack Perkins and Shane Price sharing the No. 39 car. In 2007, Coulthard, Ellery and Owen Kelly drove the second car.

In 2008, Russell Ingall joined as the driver of the second car bringing title sponsorship from Supercheap Auto. At the end of the year, Morris retired and was replaced by Tim Slade in a deal brokered by former V8 Supercar team owner James Rosenberg, who also took on ownership of Slade's car.

In 2010, Greg Murphy replaced Tim Slade with backing from Castrol.Murphy confirmed as Castrol driver at PMM Speedcafe 17 December 2008 The team moved away from self-built cars, buying two Triple Eight Race Engineering Commodore VEs.PMM to benefit from transition phase Speedcafe 23 February 2010

In 2011, Murphy was replaced by Steve Owen.

====Customer entry and demise====
With Ingall and Supercheap Auto departing at the end of 2011, one REC was leased to Tekno Autosports while preparation of the remaining car was contracted to Dick Johnson Racing. The team's two Commodore VEs also passed to Tekno in exchange for a Ford Falcon FG. In 2013, the remaining REC was sold to Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport.Lucas Dumbrell set to buy second V8 licence Speedcafe 18 November 2012 At the end of the year, the leased REC was returned from Tekno Autosports and sold to Dick Johnson Racing. This signalled the end of the team after 13 years in the championship.

==Other racing activities==
After Morris' full-time V8 Supercars career ended at the end of the 2008 season, his team entered the Development Series, later known as Super2, in every season up until 2018. Morris himself entered selected rounds from 2009 to 2015, while at its peak the team entered four cars in the 2015 season.Paul Morris to field Gracie in Dunlop Series Speedcafe 19 November 2014 The team won its only two championship rounds in 2017 with Anton De Pasquale at the wheel.
