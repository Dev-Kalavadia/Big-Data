The museum was formerly located in the National University of Rosario Law School (a national historic monument built in 1889). On July 1, 2003, people attending a demonstration organized by labor unions launched fireworks and other pyrotechnic devices to attract attention, near the building. A fire broke out, forcing its evacuation. The fire damaged or destroyed around 50% of the facilities, including 80% of the museum (with the loss of 11,000 of its 13,000 exhibits).Se incendió el Museo Angel Gallardo y parte de la Facultad de Derecho .

The reconstruction of the museum required around 2 million pesos (US$660,000). The remaining exhibits were restored, and the seat of the museum was moved one block, to the building that houses the delegation of the provincial government. The museum was re-inaugurated on July 6, 2006, downsized, with a more modern concept including interactive displays.
