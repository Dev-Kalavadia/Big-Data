Hillegas was 6'3", 190 pounds (although one source says he was 6'2", 208 pounds) and he threw and batted right-handed. He attended Forest Hills High School in Sidman, Pennsylvania, and then Middle Georgia College.

==Career==
Hillegas was drafted by the California Angels in the 26th round (657th overall) of the 1983 draft. He opted not to sign that year. In 1984, he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers after being drafted 4th overall in the first round.

On August 9, 1987, Hillegas made his major league debut. He lived up to his first round status in his debut-he pitched 8 innings with 6 strikeouts and 2 earned runs for the win. Perhaps his best Major League season was his rookie year-he went 4-3 with a 3.57 ERA in 58 innings pitched.

Hillegas went 24-38, with a 4.61 ERA. He never quite lived up to his 1st round status as a whole. As a batter, he went 2-29-that's a .069 batting average. He committed 9 errors in the field, for a .900 fielding percentage.  He balked only once in his career.

He played his final game on July 17, 1993.
