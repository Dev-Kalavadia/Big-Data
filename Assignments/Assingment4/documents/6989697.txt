Title: Duff-Gordon baronets


The Duff, later Duff Gordon Baronetcy, of Halkin in the County of Aberdeen, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 12 November 1813 for James Duff, British Consul in Cádiz, with remainder to his nephew, William Gordon. Duff died unmarried in 1815 and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet, who assumed the additional surname of Duff on succeeding to the title. He was the second son of Lord Rockville, fourth son of the 2nd Earl of Aberdeen. Duff Gordon sat as Member of Parliament for Worcester.

Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, wife of the fifth Baronet, was a leading fashion designer; and, together with her sister Elinor Glyn, was one of the original 'It' girls.
