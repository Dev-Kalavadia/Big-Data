In 1956, the school district was formed and construction began on Coventry High School. The doors were opened and classes began on September 6, 1956.  The original structure contained four hallways and a somewhat central courtyard.  An expansion in 1970 added the existing technology education wing, an auxiliary gymnasium, locker room facilities, art area and new library.  It remained unchanged for over 30 years.

In 2001, a massive second renovation began which added a new science wing, computer lab, gymnasium with locker room facilities, a significantly larger auditorium, library and media center, band and music rooms and additional classrooms and storage space.  Two new courtyards were also created in the process.  Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2002.
