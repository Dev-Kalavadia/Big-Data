=== 60% rule ===
In keeping with its mission, the Fonds makes investments in all types of businesses, with or without a guarantee. However, in any given year, the proportion of unsecured investments in eligible companies must represent, on average, at least 60% of its average net assets of the previous year.

thumb|right|Complexe FTQ
Fonds shares, which are eligible for the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), can be purchased by any Québec taxpayer either through payroll deduction – available in unionized companies or government organizations (an FTQ-affiliated or other union), – preauthorized withdrawals, or a lump sum payment. Anyone can purchase Fonds shares.

In its 36-year history, the Fonds has sold $16.7 billion in shares. The Fonds relies on a network of over 2,600 local representatives—unionized employees who promote the Fonds RRSP in their workplace.

Fonds shares are a popular investment because in addition to the tax benefits individuals obtain for buying an RRSP, they also receive two additional tax credits: 15% from each government (Québec and Canada) on the first $5,000 invested each year. Fonds shares cannot be sold before retirement except under certain conditions such as loss of employment, participation in the federal government's Home Buyers’ Plan, and disability.
