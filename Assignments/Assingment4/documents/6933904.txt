==History==
thumb|Aerial view (1953)
In 1905, a major burial ground from the Iron Age came to light, which seems to be from the Golasecca culture.  Objects found in the graves indicate that the settlement was also in contact with residents of the Alpine region.  East of the city there are also some medieval ruins, which are probably built on the site of a Roman era customs post or even a pre-Roman settlement.

Pianezzo is first mentioned in 1382 as Planezio. In the 15th Century the Church of S. Pietro in Bellinzona possessed vineyards and farmsteads in Pianezzo.  In the Middle Ages, portions of the village formed part of the community of Vallemorobbia.  In 1803 this community became the political municipality of Vallemorobbia.  In 1831 it became independent after the old municipality was divided into three new municipalities; Pianezzo, Sant'Antonio and Vallemorobbia in Piano.

The village church was under the Mother Church in Bellinzona until 1600, followed by the Church of SS Giacomo e Filippo.  In the 16th Century, a new church was built on the ruins of an earlier church.  It was renovated in 1960–70 and 2002–03.  In 1680 Pianezzo became an independent parish.

Some of the tower houses in the village still show the typical construction of rural houses in the Valle Morobbia.

The local economy was based on traditional agriculture and animal husbandry.  Even today the vineyards are operated as a sideline business.  There are a number of second or vacation homes in the village.  At the beginning of the 21st century more than three-quarters of workers in Pianezzo commuted to Bellinzona and Giubiasco.
