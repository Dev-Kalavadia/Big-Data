Earp received criticism from members of the Senate for using the term "silliness" to describe sexual harassment. Earp responded by saying "I probably shouldn't have described sexual harassment as 'silliness,' although it is on a continuum". On January 3, 2020, absent a vote in the full Senate, the Senate returned her nomination to the President and after a rocky year with reports of poor management, she resigned in disgrace effective January 31, 2020.Naomi Earp, contentious head of civil rights at USDA, will step down after a year in office
