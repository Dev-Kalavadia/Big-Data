Title: Paul Geraghty



Paul Geraghty (born 3 May 1959, in Durban, South Africa) is a British based author and illustrator of children's picture books. He also writes teenage fiction and won the Young Africa Award for his first novel Pig.

== Background ==
His master read Fine Arts and English at Natal University, South Africa and holds a Higher Diploma in Education. After teaching for two years in Cape Town he took a copywriter's job in advertising. There he met John Bush, who would later go on to collaborate with him on three picture books. Since 1986 he has lived in London, UK.

Geraghty’s picture books typically centre on wildlife/environmental themes, either treated in a highly realistic manner, rich in detail, or irreverently stylised, usually illustrated in watercolour. Translated into over 20 languages internationally, his work has won various awards, including the Red House Children's Book Award for Solo in 1996.

A frequent lecturer and live illustrator on the literary circuit, he is renowned for his inspirational, if eccentric style with audiences of all ages.

He is also a musician, photographer and extensive traveller.
