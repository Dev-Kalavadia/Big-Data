Title: Silkheart Records


Silkheart Records is a Swedish record company and label dedicated to improvised music and free jazz.

Lars-Olof Gustavsson and Keith Knox founded Silkheart in 1985. In 1991, Jimmy Johnson of Forced Exposure suggested that Silkheart "could easily be considered for the new ESP-Disk throne." The Penguin Guide to Jazz describes the four albums that Dennis González recorded for the label as "part of a determined effort to wrest creative initiative back from New York and the West Coast". Charles Brackeen (whom Silkheart's management and González had coaxed out of retirement) recorded three albums for Silkheart.
