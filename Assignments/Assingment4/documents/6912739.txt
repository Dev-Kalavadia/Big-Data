Title: Dustin Dollin



Dustin Dollin (born 27 June 1980) is an Australian professional skateboarder who is one of the original team riders for Baker Skateboards

==Early life==
Dollin was born in Ballina, New South Wales, Australia, and raised in Katoomba, New South Wales. In a 2006 interview, Dollin stated in relation to his place of origin:


"Growing up is growing up. It doesn't really matter where you are because you don't really know any better when you're a kid. I knew I was poor, but that again just teaches you how to swindle money. Also, where I grew up is one of the most beautiful places in the world. And I would know; I've been everywhere."

In a 2008 interview, Dollin explained that he hates returning to Katoomba because "too many old friends are junkies."

==Professional skateboarding==
Following Dollin's appearance at the Tampa Am contest, the Stereo skateboard brand agreed to recruit him to its "flow" program. Former professional skateboarder Danny Gonzales recalled thinking at the time: "At 17 the dude was already a wastoid. Later that night when we bar hopped, I kept either seeing or hearing him yelling and screaming for not getting into the bars. I thought, god, this kid’s fuckin’ crazy."

Dollin was asked to ride for the Vans footwear company in 1999 and has identified John Cardiel as his favorite Vans team member. However, in a 2013 interview, Dollin referred to the Vans team as a "family" and declined to nominate a favorite rider.
