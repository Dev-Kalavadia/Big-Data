==History==
The name comes from the family of Bethmann.You can bank on a good time in Frankfurt Retrieved 25 August 2013 Legend has it that Parisian pastry chef Jean Jacques Gautenier developed the recipe for banker and city councilor Simon Moritz von Bethmann in 1838.British in Germany, Living in Germany Retrieved 25 August 2013 Originally the Bethmännchen were decorated with four almonds, one for each son of Simon Moritz. After the death of his son Heinrich in 1845, the fourth almond was removed. However, this story is unlikely, since Simon Moritz had died already in 1826.

After one and a half centuries of manufacturing, its form and recipe has never been changed.Christmas Recipe from the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in London  Retrieved 25 August 2013
