==History==

===Early history===
The Padanilam Temple is believed to be Swayambhu. Its actual history and the facts about how worship started there are unknown. Padanilam has been the administrative centre of Nooranad and it has history of intense conflict between various karakal (territories) around the temple. This was for gaining control over the temple administration and thereby controlling the entire village. Due to this pada (battle/conflict), the place is said to have got its name. It is believed that the army troops of Kayamkulam Kingdom had camped near the temple for protecting the kingdom from the attack of neighbouring kings. During this period, the village had some chieftains and their supporters. They include Noorukodi Unnithans, Kadackal Karuppans, Vettathasaans and Velladickal Karuppans. Kayamkulam Raja withdrew his troops about four centuries ago. This initiated tensions between the chieftains for control of the village. Thus they divided into south and north, starting a fierce battle. The south side consisted of Noorukodi Karuppans and Kadackal Karuppans. The north side had Vettathasans and Velladickal Karuppans with them. Twenty-two karakal supported their respective sides. During the battle, many soldiers on both sides died in large numbers. They were buried in the chira near the temple. Even from very earliest of times, this temple was a blessing for the people in the surrounding areas. It is also believed that the battle was between the king Marthanda Varma on one side and the king of Kayamkulam on the other. The twenty-two karakals of Nooranad picked their respective sides. The common people started worrying about the devastation of the war and approached the Pazhoor Panamana Thampuran to find a solution to end the war. He tried to intervene but the parties were not in a position to stop. He made a tent in the eastern part of the temple and started fasting unto death. But even that did not deter the warring parties. When he was on the verge of death due to the fast, they fearing the Brahmanasaapam, agreed to stop war. They demarcated the boundary in the north-south direction and stopped the war in the name of Parabrahma, the presiding deity of the temple. The St. Thomas Syrian Orthodox Church is about 150 meters from the Padanilam Market and Padanilam High School. It is an old church which was founded 100 years before and the founder Mr. Varu Varghese was originally from Kuravilangadu. He belongs to the family of Pakalomattom, which was said to be one among the four families which were said to be baptized by St. Thomas, the disciple of Jesus Christ in AD 52. His tomb is at the St. Thomas Orthodox Church. Two brothers of the family came to Padanilam and one is settled in Padanilam and the other in Nooranad. One of the patriarchs of the family is known as Padanilathu Ashaan (late Mr. Geevarghese Kochukunju) and the junction north to the church is known as Ashaan Mukku. The St. Thomas Orthodox Church and the Padanilam Parabrahma Temple are located in heart of Padanilam.
