Title: USA Limoges
USA Limoges is a French rugby union club currently competing in Fédérale 1, the top level of the French amateur rugby pyramid and one level below the professional leagues. They finished second-from-bottom in the second professional level, Rugby Pro D2, in both 2007 and 2008. In 2007, they received a reprieve from relegation to the amateur ranks during the close season when another Pro D2 club, UA Gaillac, were denied a professional license due to financial problems. However, they would have no such luck in 2008, as all clubs above them on the league table passed their required financial audits. The club, founded in 1902, play their home matches at Parc municipal de Beaublanc. They wear blue and red.

They are based in Limoges in the Haute-Vienne in the centre of France. Their most recent success was in 2005-06, when they finished second in Fédérale 1 to Gaillac and won the promotion playoffs to earn a place in Pro D2.
