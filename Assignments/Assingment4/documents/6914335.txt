Title: David Oakley


David K. Oakley (April 27, 1945 – July 2, 2006) was an American professional golfer whose greatest success came on the European Seniors Tour.

Oakley was born in New York, but grew up in Panama City, Florida. He got started in golf by his mother, who thought a nine-hole course near their home would make a fine babysitter for Oakley and his brother. Oakley was the older brother of American professional golfer Pete Oakley.

Oakley attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he was a walk-on member of coach Buster Bishop's Florida Gators men's golf team from 1965 to 1967.Florida Men's Golf 2011 Media Supplement , University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 35 & 41 (2010). Retrieved July 14, 2011. As a Gator golfer, he was a member of teams that won Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships in 1965 and 1967. He graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1967.

Oakley turned pro in 1970 and toured Europe, Asia, Canada and the United States before hanging up his clubs in 1976 to concentrate on a business career unrelated to golf. He spent ten years as a hotel liquidator and nine as a furniture store manager and regained his amateur status. He returned to professional golf in 1996 and played on various senior circuits."Oakley passes away , " PGATour.com (July 5, 2006). Retrieved July 29, 2011.
