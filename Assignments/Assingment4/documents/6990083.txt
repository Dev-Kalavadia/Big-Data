The B-side for "Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above" is the cut "Acho Um Pouco Bom" (roughly "I think it's a bit good", in Portuguese).

==Accolades and media==
The song was rated as the sixth best track of the year 2006 by the NME magazine and named the 299th best song of the 2000s by Pitchfork Media.  In October 2011, NME placed it at number 94 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".

Following its use in promotions for the TV series, Ugly Betty, the track was re-released in the United Kingdom. It was also used in trailers for the BBC Three series, Gavin & Stacey, for the TV advertising of the Chloé Fragrance, and on the Microsoft Zune music player as pre-loaded content.
