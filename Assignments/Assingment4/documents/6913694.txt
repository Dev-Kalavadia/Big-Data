==Work==
Michel de Bouillon's signed works are rare. He specialized in flower pieces, still lifes of fruit and market scenes as well as hunting and vanitas still lifes.

His work shows influences by both the French and Flemish schools. His floral garland paintings around cartouches and vases of flowers presented in a niche are somewhat archaic. His decorative compositions that bring together a wreath of flowers, fruits, games and various objects in an architectural context are linked to the decorative production of the end of the 17th century. In the painting Kitchen scene with Christ in the house of Martha and Mary he is in the vein of painters such as Joachim Beuckelaer, in associating a religious subject rejected in the background, with a kitchen scene with a sumptuous still life.
