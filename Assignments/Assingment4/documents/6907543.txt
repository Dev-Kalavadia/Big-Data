Title: WFGY



WFGY (98.1 FM, "Froggy 98.1") is a commercial radio station licensed to serve Altoona, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by Seven Mountains Media through licensee Southern Belle Media Family, LLC, and broadcasts a Froggy-branded country format.

WFGY is the flagship station of the Froggy Radio network of stations in the region, which also includes WFGI-FM (Froggy 95.5 on 95.5 MHz), licensed to serve Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and WFGE (Big Froggy 101.1 on 101.1 MHz), licensed to serve State College, Pennsylvania.

WFGY is a grandfathered “superpower” station. While the station’s effective radiated power (ERP) is within the maximum limit allowed for a Class B FM station, its antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) is too high for its ERP according to current FCC rules.

The sister stations of WFGY in the Altoona market are 100.1 WALY, 103.9 WQWY, 104.9 WRKY-FM, 1290 WFBG, and 1430 WTNA.

==History==
===Beginnings as WFBG-FM===
The Federal Communications Commission granted Triangle Publications, Inc. a construction permit for the station on April 8, 1959, with the WFBG-FM call sign. The station signed on October 17, 1960, and was granted its first license on March 26, 1962.

On September 20, 1972, the FCC granted a voluntary reassignment of the station's license to The Gilcom Corporation.

The station was best known for being Blair County's exclusive easy listening station, primarily automated, like others of its day. However, change would come by the start of the 1990s.

===Switchover to Froggy===
On April 2, 1991, the station's call sign was changed to WFGY. Forever of PA, LLC (Forever Media) purchased the station on July 31, 1996, with the sale consummating on August 31, 1996. The station adopted the "Froggy 98" branding while changing format to country music. The station became known for its colorful presentation, with jingles resembling a frog's croak (or, as they proclaimed, "ribbit"), as well as the even more colorful names assigned to its on-air staff. The station also promoted a family-friendly image and did station giveaways catering to families.
