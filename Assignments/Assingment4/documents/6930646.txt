==History==
thumb|left|upright|Funicular to Lago Ritom
A grave from the early Iron Age has been found in the valley.  The modern municipality of Quinto is first mentioned in 1227.  The old Vicinanza, whose statutes were first written in 1408, consisted of numerous degagne.  They owned alpine pastures, particularly on the Alp Piora, and the rights to provide donkeys or mules for freight transport over the passes.

Quinto originally belonged to the parish of Biasca, but had already separated into an independent parish before the 12th Century. The parish church of SS Peter and Paul was first mentioned in 1227, but dates from the 8th-9th Century.  The original romanesque building was extended several times and completely rebuilt in 1681.

The local economy was dominated by agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and dairy farming.  In 1896, the first dairy cooperative opened in the village. The commissioning of the Gotthard Railway in 1882, the 1910 drainage project and the 1982-83 construction of the A2 motorway led to the economic growth and development of Quinto.

The now decommissioned Cantonal Sanatorium in Piotta, was in operation from 1905-62.  The military airfield in Ambrì operated between 1940-94.  In 1920, Lago Ritom power station for the Swiss Federal Railways came online.  A steep funicular railway goes up the mountainside to the lake and dam.  While economic growth slowed between the 1950s and the 70s, some major industries, especially in metal processing, electronics, woodworking and carpentry, were active.  Since the 1980s the municipality has been shrinking.

Founded in 1937, the Hockey Club Ambri-Piotta plays a significant role for the economy of the region.  Since 1989, Quinto houses the Center for Alpine Biology on Alp Piora.  The Alp Piora is also known as tourist destination and for its cheese.
