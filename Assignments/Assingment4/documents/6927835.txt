Title: Reza Sadeghi




Reza Sadeghi (, born 16 August 1979) is an Iranian pop singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, and one of the most popular domestic singers in Iran. He is praised for his vocals and song writing, which are mainly about the subject of love. He has performed live concerts in different cities around Iran and in other countries, including Germany and the United States.

== Personal life ==
Born in 1979, Reza Sadeghi was raised in Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, and then moved to Tehran at the age of 5. He was a close friend of former domestic footballer Ali Ansarian, who he befriended in primary school.

Reza Sadeghi's first spouse died in a car crash in which he was left paralyzed and was required to use an assistive cane for the rest of his life, including during concerts, where he usually rests besides a cane. Since the crash, Sadeghi has decided to appear in public in fully black clothing. Due to this, he is known as Siah Poosh (lit. who wears black, or man in black). Many of his compositions are based around the color black, including his best-known song Meshki Rang-e Eshghe (Black is the Color of Love).

During Sadeghi's Germany tour, he met and proposed to an Iranian resident of Germany. Together, they have two girls named Tiara and Viana, aged 7 and 4 respectively.

==Music and film career==
Reza Sadeghi initially picked up guitar lessons and recorded his first compositions, which were circulated in his home town years later. Facing financial difficulties in Tehran, Sadeghi turned to music as a professional career. Initially appearing on live radio, Sadeghi released his first songs to a small reception, including the single Raz-e Eshgh (Secret of Love), and his first album of the same title. Sadeghi joined the band Kimia (کیمیا), releasing four more albums, until he left the group after the release of Gol-e Laleh. He gradually built up a base and organised concerts in Tehran, including one in front of 15,000 at Sa'dabad Complex. He then moved to Mehrshahr, a small town near Karaj.

Sadeghi's first foreign tour was in Germany in 2011. He also toured in major cities of the United States in his 2016 US Tour.

In 2008, Mostafa Mansourian released a biographical film named Ramze Shab (Secret of the Night), based around Reza Sadeghi's personal life. Reza Sadeghi also appeared alongside Mohammad Reza Foroutan, Afshin Hashemi, Pegah Ahangarani, in the film Bi khodahafezi[fa] (Without a Goodbye) which is partially based on his life.
