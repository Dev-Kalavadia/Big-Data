Title: Honda Zest



The Honda Zest is a kei car released in 2006 by Honda. It is mechanically identical to the fifth generation Honda Life. Equipped with a turbo charged engine, 3 cylinders, and 4 doors, it was the first kei car available with optional side curtain airbags. It was available in two distinct versions â€” Zest and Zest Sports. During fall/winter 2008, the Zest Sports was replaced with the Zest Spark. Honda enlisted J-Pop mega-star Ayumi Hamasaki to promote the Zest Spark.  The Ayu x ZEST SPARK collaboration has come to the extent where the limited edition of the vehicle features Ayu's "A" logo, known as "A Style Package".
