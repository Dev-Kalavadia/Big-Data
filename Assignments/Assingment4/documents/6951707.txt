Title: Eddie Machen


Edward Mills "Eddie" Machen (June 15, 1932 – August 8, 1972) was an American professional boxer. He was one of 6 children of a rural mail carrier. Machen dropped out of high school and became an amateur boxer. However, after just 3 bouts he was arrested and convicted of armed robbery. After his release, he became a professional boxer, determined never to return to prison again. His 64-bout career began on March 22, 1955, and he went on to win his first 24 bouts. He was highly rated and fought most of the big names of his era.

==Professional career==

===Early career===
Machen often fought at Civic Auditorium or the Cow Palace in San Francisco. His first bout was with fellow first-timer Raul Flores, whom he knocked out in the first round. He had eleven fights in 1955 and the six-foot, 195-pounder won them all, ten by knockout or technical knockout. He had eight more wins in 1956 against better competition. In 1957, he won all five fights he had, including two over former light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim. The Maxim wins made him a ranked contender.

In April 1958, he met highly ranked Zora Folley and fought to a draw over 12 rounds. But he was then knocked out in one round by undefeated future heavyweight champion Ingemar Johansson, in September. After being caught flush by a big right hand Machen was floored three times, the last for some minutes.

On the comeback trail in 1959, Machen posted seven straight wins to return him to contention. In January 1960, he lost a decision to Folley at the Cow Palace. Later that year he met top contender and future champion, Sonny Liston, and although he lost by a clear 12-round unanimous decision, fought a sharp hit and move match that many believed was later studied by heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. Liston was penalized three times for low blows in that match.

1961 began with two wins, then a very controversial loss to Harold Johnson by decision.  Again, he came back with three very good wins, including a decision over undefeated Doug Jones. In 1962, Machen had two more wins before he had a draw with high-ranked big hitter Cleveland Williams in Houston in July 1962.  In 1963 he resumed fighting and scored four straight knockouts to finish the year. He fought just twice in 1964, battling his personal issues. One was a win, the other a close 12-round loss to another former heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson in Sweden in July 1964.

===Title shot and late career===
In 1965, Machen  received his first world title shot when he and 6' 6" Ernie Terrell met for the vacated World Boxing Association title that had been stripped from Muhammad Ali.  Terrell won the 15-round decision. In 1966 he lost a decision to German southpaw Karl Mildenberger in Germany, then lost a close split-decision to powerful slugger Manuel Ramos. But he closed that year with two wins, one particularly notable over future contender Jerry Quarry, which was Quarry's first defeat

=== Versus Joe Frazier===
In late 1966, Machen fought young future heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and lost in a tenth-round technical knockout. Downed in the first round, Machen continued to try to out-slug rather than out-box the relentless Frazier.

===Retirement===
Machen retired in 1967 at age 35 following consecutive losses to Henry Clark, Boone Kirkman and Joe Frazier.

==Health and death==
Machen was admitted to the Napa State Hospital in the fall of 1962 after threatening to commit suicide. Biographies state he suffered from clinical depression. He later filed for bankruptcy in 1966 and retired from boxing in 1967. His final record was 50-11-3, with 27 KOs.

Eddie Machen was found dead in San Francisco on August 8, 1972, apparently the result of a fall from a second story apartment window. He was 40 years old. It is not known if the cause of death was suicide, accident, or murder.http://ringtalk.com/eddie-machen-sonny-liston-don-chargin
