==Reception==
Paula Guran in Cinefantastique writes "Although [ Robert E. Howard's original Conan stories] were a huge influence, the Cimmerian really didn't begin to pervade our culture until the 1970s, due to the comics series and pastiches such as these. L. Sprague de Camp may be disdained for his 'editing' ... of original Howard material ... but his works are enjoyable and acceptable to most sword and sorcery fans, and it's nice to have them back in print. We're not sure why this is subtitled as three novels. This omnibus consists  of two novels, 'Conan the Liberator' and 'Conan and the Spider God' (both by de Camp and Carter), and 'Conan the Swordsman' (a collection that also includes work by Bjorn Nyberg)." She gives the book three stars.Guran, Paula. "Sagas of Conan" [review]. Cinefantastique, v. 36, iss. 2, April/May 2004, pp. 64-65.
