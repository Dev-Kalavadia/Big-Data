==Plot==

In 1880, when bareknuckle fighting is still condoned. John L. Sullivan chooses boxing over baseball and becomes known as "the Boston Strong Boy" after his victory over established prizefighter John Flood.

Sullivan's sweetheart, Kathy Harkness, refuses his marriage proposal, unhappy about how he has chosen to make a living. After he wins the heavyweight championship, Sullivan buys a tavern and begins drinking too much of his own product. He also meets New York singer Anne Livingston, marrying her on the rebound from Kathy and traveling the world, meeting British royalty while fighting abroad.

Sullivan's ego and alcoholism grow out of control. Anne realizes he still loves Kathy and leaves him, but Kathy still disapproves of his life. Sullivan is defeated by "Gentleman" Jim Corbett, loses the heavyweight crown and also loses his saloon, due to growing debts. Anne, too, becomes bankrupt as well as terminally ill. Sullivan vows to turn his life around, speaking on behalf of temperance unions as Kathy sees a glimmer of hope for their future.

== Critical response ==
"A curious mixture of excitement and tedious drama make up the picture The Great John L, which arrived at the Globe on Saturday, a promising augury for the newly launched Bing Crosby Productions ... It is only after he loses to Corbett and his wife dies that “Honest John” marries his boyhood sweetheart and turns to the better life. But the process is overlong and occasionally boring."

"In his first independent production, Bing Crosby comes out with both fists swinging through a dramatization of the life of John L. Sullivan. When the pic is released, it should be a great day all around, for the Irish, as well as for the houses that run it. It’s straight boff from start to finish."
