==Company history==

Brothers Ernest and Henri Maus together with Léon Nordmann opened their first department store in Lucerne in 1902, under the “Léon Nordmann” name. The more familiar “Manor” – a combination of the founders’ Maus and Nordmann surnames – did not appear until a new corporate identity was adopted in about 1965.

All the company’s department stores in German-speaking Switzerland have borne the Manor name since 1994, and all the stores in the rest of the country have carried the name since September 2000.
