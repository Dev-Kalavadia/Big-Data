Title: 1974 (We Were Young)

"1974 (We Were Young)" is a 1988 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the third single from her album Lead Me On.

==The song==
The song is about Grant's discovery of faith at the age of fourteen (Grant was born on November 25, 1960), the first verse saying, "We were young...Down upon our knees/we tasted holy wine." In the chorus, Grant tells of God's love at the founding of Him, saying, "Purer than the sky behind the rain...Love had lit a fire we were the flame."  The final verses talk about how the discovery of God changes people: "No one had to say we were changed/Nothing else we lived through would ever be the same" and how those who experience God's love never want it to go away: "Stay with me/Make it ever new."  In interviews following the release of the song, she revealed that it should have been titled "1975".

==Chart success==
Unlike Grant's previous few singles, "1974" did not achieve mainstream success. Although a #1 Christian single, "1974" only managed to reach #34 on the Adult Contemporary chart, to date Grant's worst performance on that chart.
The B side of the single is "If You Have to Go Away", another track from the album.
