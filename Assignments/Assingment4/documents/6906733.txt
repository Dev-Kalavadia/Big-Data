Malpee went bankrupt in 1963, and KFIL went silent. George W. Smith bought the station out of bankruptcy the next year and changed its call sign to KYMS. The new station broadcast from studios in the Saddleback Inn Hotel in Santa Ana, with "prestige-type" easy listening music. It also received a first-of-its-kind authorization from the Federal Communications Commission to rebroadcast news programs from the BBC World Service received via shortwave.

In 1968, KYMS was sold to Southwestern Broadcasters. The station aired a progressive rock format in the early 1970s.Hall, Claude. "Vox Jox", Billboard. July 31, 1971. p. 30. Retrieved June 7, 2019.
