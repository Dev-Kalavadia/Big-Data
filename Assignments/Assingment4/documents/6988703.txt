Title: Paul Hearty





Paul Hearty is an Irish Gaelic footballer who played as goalkeeper for the Armagh county team. He was named in goal for the 2006 Irish News Ulster Allstars team for his performances in Armagh's 2006 Uster championship win.

Hearty was part of the Crossmaglen team that won 13 Armagh Senior Football Championships in a row between 1996 and 2008. This equals the national record for consecutive county football championships set by Ballina Stephenites of Mayo between 1904 and 1916. The 2008 win was Crossmaglen's 37th in all, also drawing them level with Castleblayney Faughs's record of most county football championships ever. Hearty has also won the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship seven times and the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship four times with the club. Hearty, along with Ois√≠n McConville, John McEntee, Tony McEntee, Francie Bellew and Cathal Short is one of six Crossmaglen players to have shared in all these successes since 1996.
