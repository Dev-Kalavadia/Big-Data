Title: Binary erasure channel
thumb|right|The channel model for the binary erasure channel showing a mapping from channel input X to channel output Y (with known erasure symbol ?).  The probability of erasure is p_e

In coding theory and information theory, a binary erasure channel (BEC) is a communications channel model. A transmitter sends a bit (a zero or a one), and the receiver either receives the bit correctly, or with some probability P_e receives a message that the bit was not received ("erased") .

== Definition ==
A binary erasure channel with erasure probability P_e is a channel with binary input, ternary output, and probability of erasure P_e. That is, let X be the transmitted random variable with alphabet \{0,1\}. Let Y be the received variable with alphabet \{0,1,\text{e} \}, where \text{e} is the erasure symbol. Then, the channel is characterized by the conditional probabilities:

:\begin{align}
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 0 | X = 0 ] &= 1 - P_e \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 0 | X = 1 ] &= 0 \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 1 | X = 0 ] &= 0 \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = 1 | X = 1 ] &= 1 - P_e \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = e | X = 0 ] &= P_e \\
\operatorname {Pr} [ Y = e | X = 1 ] &= P_e
\end{align}

== Capacity ==
The channel capacity of a BEC is 1-P_e, attained with a uniform distribution for X (i.e. half of the inputs should be 0 and half should be 1).

|By symmetry of the input values, the optimal input distribution is X \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right). The channel capacity is:
:\operatorname{I}(X;Y) = \operatorname{H}(X)-\operatorname{H}(X|Y)

Observe that, for the binary entropy function \operatorname{H}_\text{b} (which has value 1 for input \frac{1}{2}),
:\operatorname{H}(X|Y)=\sum_y P(y)\operatorname{H}(X|y)=P_e \operatorname{H}_{\text{b}}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = P_e
as X is known from (and equal to) y unless y=e, which has probability P_e.

By definition \operatorname{H}(X)=\operatorname{H}_{\text{b}}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=1, so
:\operatorname{I}(X;Y) = 1-P_e.

If the sender is notified when a bit is erased, they can repeatedly transmit each bit until it is correctly received, attaining the capacity 1-P_e. However, by the noisy-channel coding theorem, the capacity of 1-P_e can be obtained even without such feedback.

== Related channels ==
If bits are flipped rather than erased, the channel is a binary symmetric channel (BSC), which has capacity 1 - \operatorname H_\text{b}(P_e) (for the binary entropy function \operatorname{H}_\text{b}), which is less than the capacity of the BEC for 0<P_e<1/2. If bits are erased but the receiver is not notified (i.e. does not receive the output e) then the channel is a deletion channel, and its capacity is an open problem.

== History ==
The BEC was introduced by Peter Elias of MIT in 1955 as a toy example.
