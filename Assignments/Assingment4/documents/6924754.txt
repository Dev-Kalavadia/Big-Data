Title: Sincerely Yours (One Voice album)



Sincerely Yours is the second album by R&B group One Voice. The album was supposed to show their growth as artists, but was less successful than their debut album and received mixed reviews. Along with the album came a new sexy image, a la Britney Spears. The album would only sell 20,000 copies in the United States and 25,000 copies in the Philippines where it only went silver. This would be their last album with Kamikaze.

"Swing Your Love 2 Me" and "So Badd" were both released as singles, but both failed to find success.
