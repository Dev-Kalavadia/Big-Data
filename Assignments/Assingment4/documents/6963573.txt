Diviseema is a small and deltaic island in Krishna District of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It comprises three Mandals - Ghantasala, Avanigadda, Koduru and Nagayalanka.

== Etymology ==
The word Diviseema translates as the abode of the divine.

Diviseema is obtained from the two words Deevi meaning 'island' and seema meaning 'country' or 'region' in telugu... Diviseema (pronounced as Deeviseema) means 'Region of the Island'...

== Geography ==
Diviseema is located in the delta area formed at Puligadda (Avanigadda), where the Krishna River is divided into two before merging into the Bay of Bengal. One merges in Bay of Bengal at Hamsaladeevi (Koduru mandal) and the other near to Gullalamoda (Nagayalanka mandal).

It is a fertile low lying plain interspersed with Krishna river and its distributaries. It is irrigated by canal irrigation drawn from Prakasam Barrage at Vijayawada. The confluence of Krishna River and Bay of Bengal at Palakayatippa is a weekend getaway and also a pilgrimage center. Towards the sea, Diviseema has rich mangroves and is notified as Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary.
