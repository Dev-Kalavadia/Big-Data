==History==
WCTC is considered New Jersey's first radio station built during the post-World War II broadcast boom. It signed on in 1946.  The following year, it added an FM station, 98.3 WCTC-FM (today WMGQ).  WCTC derives its call sign from the Chanticleer, a flamboyant fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart). It is also used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales which was the Rutgers mascot from 1925 to 1955.

From the 1960s through the 1980s, it adopted a full service middle of the road (MOR) format featuring local news, talk, sports, and adult popular music.  For most of those years, Jack Ellery was the popular wake-up host.

In 1992, WCTC gave up music programming, switching to All-Talk, featuring programming from ABC Radio and Premiere Radio Networks. As of July 2, 2008, WCTC went back to its roots by reverting to an oldies music format.

On February 28, 2011, WCTC changed the format back to talk, launching the local midday show "New Jersey TODAY" from one to three in the afternoon hosted by Bert Baron.

On July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WCTC) for $240 million.

Under Beasley ownership, WCTC was the primary source for winter school closing announcements. WCTC's former Talk format included "This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal", "Markley, Van Camp & Robbins," Guy Benson, and local host Tommy G. in afternoon drive time.  WCTC carried hourly news from NBC News Radio.  WCTC also aired special interest shows on the weekends.

In July 2021, WCTC began simulcasting on an FM translator, 93.5 W228DY.WCTC/New Brunswick, NJ Adds FM Translator Simulcast  On September 27, 2021, the wctcam.com web site began redirecting to Fox Sports New Jersey.
