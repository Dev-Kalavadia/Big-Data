Lindsay was born at 49 Moray Place in western Edinburgh on 20 November 1900, the eldest son of the 27th Earl of Crawford and 10th Earl of Balcarres and his wife, Constance Lilian Perry.

He was educated at Eton, graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford in 1922 and entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lonsdale two years later, at the 1924 general election. He held his seat until he succeeded to his father's titles in May 1940 and was also Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1924 and to the Ministry of Health from 1931 to 1940.

In 1951, Lord Crawford was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the Arts, having been a trustee of the Tate Gallery from 1932 to 1937, the National Gallery from 1935 to 1941, 1945–52 and 1953–60, the British Museum from 1940 to 1973 and a member of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries from 1937 to 1952, Chairman of the Trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland from 1952 to 1972, the Royal Fine Arts Commission from 1943 to 1957 and the Trustees of the National Library of Scotland in 1944.

In 1953 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John F. Allen, David Jack, Edward Copson, and Daniel Edwin Rutherford. In 1954, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. He was awarded the Order of the Thistle in 1955 for his time spent as Rector of the University of St Andrews from 1952 to 1955.

From 1945 to 1965 he was chairman of the National Trust. From 1963 until his death, he also acted as Premier Earl of Scotland.The Premier Earldom in the Peerage of Scotland is that of Sutherland, created circa 1230. Held for a long time by the Leveson-Gower family, this earldom passed to Elizabeth Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland (1921–2019) in 1963, who, as a woman, was at the time considered to be unsuitable for functioning as Premier Earl, so the Earls of Crawford, being next in the order of precedence, occupied the position until the earldom of Sutherland passed to a male holder (Alistair Sutherland, 25th Earl of Sutherland, born 1947) in 2019.

He died at Balcarres House, near Colinsburgh in Fife on 13 December 1975. He is buried in the family chapel at Balcarres House.
