== History ==
In March 1968, taxpayers of District 228 approved a US$1.3 million loan from the Illinois School Building Commission to begin first phase construction of the district's fourth high school.  In August 1968, the Board of Education approved the new school's name, and in September, the architectural plans were approved.Bremen Board OK's Plan for High School, 29 September, 1968, Chicago Tribune, p. S9;  accessed 1 September 2008  The construction contract was approved in March 1969, with the plan calling for an initial "first phase" of construction, and a second phase to be added on if necessary.Bremen School Board Awards High School Construction Contract, 27 March 1969, Chicago Tribune, p.

Oak Forest High School opened in 1971 as a remedy to the excessively high numbers of students attending the three other existing high schools in the district.  Before the school had even opened, it became clear that the school would not be sufficient to contain the increasing student population.  The district again turned to voters to approve a bond issue to add onto the school.Colvin, Robert, Second 'Go-Round' Slated for Vote on Building Bond Issue, 13 June 1971, Chicago Tribune, p. S_A12;  accessed 1 September 2008  After two failures, and threats of students needing to attend double shifts, the bond issue passed in December 1971.Voters to Decide High School Fate, 25 November 1971, Chicago Tribune, p.

On December 2, 1985, a fire broke out at the school causing severe damage to the school's electric systems.  After missing a week of school, and with the building still not inhabitable, Oak Forest students were required to temporarily attend classes at Tinley Park High School with split shifts set up (Tinley Park students from 7 am to noon, and Oak Forest students from 12:40 to 6 pm).Fegelman, Andrew, Fire makes odd schoolfellows;  Blaze forces Oak Forest students to attend rival, 10 December 1985, Chicago Tribune, p.

Construction to the building in the summer of 2005 created a new Instructional Materials Center (IMC), which serves as media lab and library.  Additionally, the space occupied by the old IMC was re-structured into additional classrooms, a move towards solving the approaching five-year deadline of the outdoor portable classroom mobile units (commonly referred to as the "trailers"). The room numbers were also changed in the process with the numbering system developed by Adam Hillier (Class of 2005).
