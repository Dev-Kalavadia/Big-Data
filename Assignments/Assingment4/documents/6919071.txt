==History==
Iragna is first mentioned in 1210 as Inagna.

Iragna was one of the ten village cooperatives (Vicini), which formed the municipality of Levantine.  It belonged to the valley community in 1441 when the entire Levantine along with Lodrino and its hamlets were conquered by Uri.  At that time Iragna became part of the Vicariate of the dukes of Milan.  Under Milan, the long-established citizens of the village were allowed to select their own bailiff.  In the first half of the 17th century, the population of Iragna was involved in a series of witch trials.

The church of SS Eusebio e Gaudenzio has been in use since 1210.

Since Iragna was on a road that offered an alternative route to the traditional trans-alpine route through Biasca, it possessed a travellers hospice starting in 1288.  The hospice was supported and directed by the hospice in Pollegio.

Iragna's chestnut forests were used to provide wood to residents of the middle and upper Leventina.  Granite mining has been a major source of income since the end of the 19th century.
