===The Last Window-Giraffe===
The Last Window-Giraffe is a memoir about the absurdity of everyday life under a dictatorship. It is written in the style of an actual Hungarian children's dictionary, The Window-Giraffe (in the Hungarian version of this A to Z, 
Ablak=Window is the first item and Zsiráf=Giraffe is the last). The dictionary explained the whole world in simple words, where everything was in order and problems were always solved.

The Last Window-Giraffe also recounts the events of the Belgrade protests of 1996-97, which it describes as being symbolic of protests everywhere in their courage and absurdity. The novel is filled with Zilahy's own photographs, and is an insight into the world behind the Iron Curtain.

Reviews of this work have appeared in the FAZ, The Independent, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, The Telegraph, and Die Welt.
