Title: Cureglia


Cureglia is a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Cureglia is first mentioned in 1335 as Curea or Curilia.

In 1468, the village of Comano, which belonged to Cureglia, broke away from the parish of Lugano.  Cureglia became an independent parish in 1594.  The parish church of S. Cristoforo, was first mentioned in 1420.  In the 19th century it was totally rebuilt.  The Chapel of S. Maria del Buon Consiglio was built in the 18th century.

The village was predominantly agricultural and produced mostly wine and cheese.  However, a number of craftsman families, including the Caresana, Rinaldi, Saroli, Tarilli and Brilli, moved away in the 16th and 17th centuries for work in other European countries.  Successful members of the families moved back to the village and built large homes, which are still standing in the village.  The progressive urbanization of the surrounding area of Lugano and the establishment of the television studios in Comano favored a rapid increase in population.  From 1950 to 2000, the number of residents quadrupled and housing was built outside the old village core.
