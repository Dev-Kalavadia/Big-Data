Title: Brione sopra Minusio

Brione sopra Minusio is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

==History==
Brione sopra Minusio is first mentioned in 1313 as Briono.
  
Before 1479 Brione and Minusio formed a Vicinanza, which also included Mergoscia until 1313.  Between 1479 and 1577 it began taking steps to become an independent municipality.  However, until 1952, some common property was shared between Brione sopra Minusio and other communities, which led to some conflicts.

The church of S. Maria Lauretana was built in 1558-59, and in the second half of the 19th Century it was rebuilt.  Until 1662 it belonged to S. Vittore at Locarno.  It was granted a chaplain in 1662 and a parish vicar in 1777.

Traditionally, the cultivation of wine, fruit, cereals and hemp as well as grazing were the main occupations of the inhabitants.  They had grazing rights in the Magadino valley.  The scarcity of land forced many of the residents to emigrate.  In 1990 more than 75% of the workforce worked in the services sector, mostly in tourism.  The municipality is home to many tourism facilities and second homes, and about 35% of the population are not native Italian speakers.
